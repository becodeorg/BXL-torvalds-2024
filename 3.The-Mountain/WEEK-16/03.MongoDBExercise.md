# MongoDB Exercise

---

Great ! You made it !

We are building our API development experise little by little !

Now with databases, our data is persistent !

We are gonna do a very little exercise now.

We are going to program a **Todo List** with the three sides of a fullstack application : front, server and database. Let's make them work together !

By now, you know already that they all communicate through requests and responses.

- **[FRONT:]** Create the front part with a form with a text input to insert a `todo`.
- **[SERVER:]** Create an API with GET, POST and DELETE that communicates with the database.
- **[FRONT:]** Fetch the `todos` that exist in the database and display them in the page with a button to delete it.
- **[FRONT:]** When we click the delete button of a todo, delete the todo from the database.

That's it !
Don't try to make it pretty !
I just want the functionnality of it. Don't lose to much time.
