# MongoDB

---

MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database that's widely used for its flexibility, scalability, and its document(object)-oriented approach.

It stores data in JSON-like structures called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for a more dynamic schema compared to traditional relational databases.

Think of MongoDB as a digital filing cabinet for storing all kinds of information.

Just like a filing cabinet can hold different types of documents, MongoDB can store different kinds of digital information like text, numbers, and even more complex stuff like lists or links between information.

### Key Features of MongoDB:

**Flexible Storage**: Imagine each drawer in a filing cabinet can hold any type of document, from handwritten notes to printed reports, without needing them to be in a specific format. Similarly, MongoDB can store various types of data without requiring a uniform structure. (that's what we have with SQL for example)

**No Strict Organization Required**: In some filing systems, you need to organize everything very precisely. (SQL!!!) MongoDB is more relaxed â€“ you can store different types of information together without following a strict pattern.

**Quick Access**: Just like having a quick search tool to find any document in your filing cabinet, MongoDB lets you quickly search and retrieve the information you need.

**Safe Keeping**: Like having copies of important documents in case of loss, MongoDB can keep duplicates of your data, so it's safe and always available, even if something goes wrong with one part of the system.

**Complex Sorting and Analysis**: Imagine being able to not only store your documents but also perform complex analyses on them, like summarizing data or finding patterns. MongoDB has powerful tools for analyzing and processing the data it stores.

### How it works

**Storing Data**: You add information to MongoDB in a flexible format, similar to jotting down notes in whatever way makes sense for the information you're recording.

**Retrieving Data**: When you need specific information, you ask MongoDB, and it quickly finds and presents the data, just like flipping to a page in a folder that has exactly what you need.

**Updating Data**: If information changes, you can easily update it in MongoDB, as well as editing a document in your filing cabinet.

### CRUD

To demonstrate **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MongoDB using JavaScript with Express, we'll need a basic setup. Here's how you can perform each of these operations:

#### Prerequisites:

**MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.

**Node.js and Express**: Have Node.js installed, and use npm to install Express and the MongoDB driver.

### ATTENTION !

The whole CRUD operation is showned in the YouTube series by Net Ninja. After watching it (or before, as you whish), stop following the tutorial and try to do it by yourself ! You'll thank me later ;)

First, install the necessary packages:

```
npm init -y
npm install express mongodb
```

Now, we create a simple server and connect to the database before starting to listen.

<details>
<summary>Open after completition</summary>
<br>

```js
const express = require("express");
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

const app = express();

const url = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017";
let db;

MongoClient.connect(url)
  .then((client) => {
    db = client.db("blog");
  })
  .then(() => {
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server running on port 3000");
    });
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

</details>

See ? We start listening only when the connection to the database `blog` was succesfull.

Then, we can create our routes and perform some CRUD operations :

<details>
<summary>Open after completition</summary>
<br>

```js
// GET ALL

app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  const users = [];

  db.collection("users")
    .find()
    .forEach((user) => users.push(user))
    .then(() => {
      res.json(users);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log(err);
      res.status(500).json({ msg: "Error fetching users" });
    });
});
```

```js
// GET SINGLE BY ID

app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;

  if (ObjectId.isValid(id)) {
    console.log("ID is valid");
    db.collection("users")
      .findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(id) })
      .then((user) => {
        if (user) {
          res.json(user);
        } else {
          res.json({ msg: "No user with this ID" });
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.log(err);
        res.json({ msg: "error" });
      });
  } else {
    console.log("ID IS NOT VALID");
    res.json({ msg: "No user with this ID" });
  }
});
```

```js
// POST USER

app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
  const newUser = req.body;

  db.collection("users")
    .insertOne(newUser)
    .then((result) => {
      res.json(result);
    })
    .catch((err) => res.json({ msg: "Could not post user" }));
});
```

```js
// DELETE USER

app.delete("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;

  if (ObjectId.isValid(id)) {
    db.collection("users")
      .deleteOne({ _id: new ObjectId(id) })
      .then(() => {
        res.json({ msg: "User deleted" });
      })
      .catch((err) => res.json({ msg: "Could not delete the user" }));
  } else {
    res.json({ msg: "Not a valid ID" });
  }
});
```

```js
// UPDATE USER

app.patch("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const updates = req.body;

  if (ObjectId.isValid(id)) {
    db.collection("users")
      .updateOne({ _id: new ObjectId(id) }, { $set: updates })
      .then((result) => res.json({ msg: "User updated", result }))
      .catch((err) => res.json({ msg: "Could not update user" }));
  } else {
    res.json({ msg: "Not a valid ID" });
  }
});
```

Now go look for `Mongoose`, an easier and more powerful way to work with MongoDB.
