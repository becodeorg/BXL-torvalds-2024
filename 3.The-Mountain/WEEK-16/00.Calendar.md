**TUESDAY**

- Ending SQL exercises
- Begin of MongoDB path with this wonderful [YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9h77dJ-QJlwGlZlTd4ecZOA&si=rR_nEtwfLoWg2T_3) that explains everything you need to know at this stage of our learning. My strong advice : code along with him. And create the API he does at the end.
