# BACKEND

---

Weeeeell....

**HELLOOOW THERE !!**

You've came from far !
In a matter of two months you learned from scratch :

- The terminal / Git / Markdown
- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- Javascript
  - Basic theory
  - Algorithm
  - The DOM
  - Asynchronous JS

And you survived !!!!!!

Claps to you !

Today, we are going to start working on the backend side of Web Development ! Yay !!!!

Sooner in the course, we've discussed about how the internet works, the request-response cycle in the server-client relationship and the roles of the backend.

Let's catch up !

When we talk about a web application, we're talking about code that runs in two sides :

- the client (inside the browser) and;
- the server (a computer set up to serve and **interact with the client** through **requests and responses**)

Until now, all of our code ran inside the browser. Indeed, the browser (Google Chrome for example) has an engine built-in to it that reads and executes our javascript code.

The browser also "reads" (interpret) html and css code in order to display them.

Everything happens in the browser !

But at some point, some **computer** must **be able** to **receive requests** for these html/css/js files !

This computer must know what response to send in the various different scenarios we could encounter.

Here is a veeeery concise list of examples a backend might be asked to handle :

- if I receive a GET request to the root endpoint (`/`), what should I respond with ? (some files ? an error message ? some json ?)

- if I receive a GET request to this endpoint : `/about`, what should I respond with ?

- If I receive a request to my `/my-basket` (in case of an ecommerce for example), I should respond with a page that shows the items that are in the basket. But for which user ? Is the user connected ?

- If I receive a POST request to `/login` with some data in the `Headers` in order to login. With what should I respond ? What logic should I perform ?

  - I should verify if these info in the Headers matches with the data I have in my database
  - If it's the case, I should send a response of success and implement a cookie in the browser of the user...

Etc, etc...

The backend is the part that holds the ressources to be sent and perform all the logic to respond to the several kinds of request a client can make.

The traditional language that was (and is) used for backend is PHP.

But many other languages can be used in the server, like Python, Ruby, etc.

For a long time, JavaScript was only able to be read and executed inside the browser. (The browser has an engine written in C++ that converts JavaScript into machine code)

That's when **Node** appeared !

---

**What we will learn using Node?**

- Start a server on the machine (that means : program a particular IP and PORT to listen for requests)
- Handle different kind of requests (GET, POST, etc.)
- Use middlewares (actions done between a request and response)
- Create our own API to respond with
- Interact with databases
- Implement authentication
- ...and more !
