# Express

---

`express` is a node package.

As all Node packages, its goal is to simplify the code we have to write in order to get to a specific end.

Think of the `Swiper` package. You could program a slider from scratch. But it would take a lot of lines of code. Swiper does all that under the hood and you only have to write a few lines of code in order to have a proper slider.

Same for `AOS`, `Waypoint`, `Accordion.js`, etc..

`express` is such a package (a very robust and popular one) that focuses on the setup of a server.

Everything you do with `express` can be done with native Node. But `express` simplifies the process and turns it to a less verbose code.

Let's dive into it !

#### Create a server with express

- Same as we did with native Node, create a server that listens to port 3000.
- When we launch the server, you should log to the console `Listening to port 3000`
- Create a small html file that has an `h1` with `Home page` and another page with `h1` `About page`
- When we go to port 3000 (`/` and `/about`) in our browser, we should see the corresponding html file
- Now, when we make a `POST` request to port 3000, you should get, in JSON, the object :

```js
{
    school: "BeCode",
    year: "2023"
}
```

(use Postman in order to do a POST request)

- Same as the last exercise, make that when we enter the `/about-us` route, we are redirected to the route `/about`
- Check the status code of this request. (`express` infers the correct status code for almost every route with its method)
- Now, create a 404 page in html and display it if the route doesn't exist.
  - In order to do that, you will have to to use the `use()` method. This will be seen more in depth when we'll talk about `middlewares`. For now, you just have to understand that the express server reads all the code untill it finds a match and then it stops.
  - Watch out that the status code is not infered with the `use()` method

```js
const express = require("express");

// The "express" function returns an object that contains many methods such as 'listen', 'get', 'post', 'use', etc.
const app = express();

// 'listen' establishes a port to be listened and a callback function that fires as soon as the server is launched.
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Listening to port 3000");
});

// Just so we don't have to write down {root: __dirname} at every request
const root = __dirname;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile("./views/index.html", { root });
});

app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile("./views/about.html", { root });
});

app.get("/about-us", (req, res) => {
  res.redirect("/about");
});

const obj = {
  school: "BeCode",
  year: 2023,
};

app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  // Sends json back
  res.json(obj);
});
// Later, we will eventually be sending data from a database

// Remember that the code will run untill it finds a match. "use" is a match for any request. So in this case, we want to put it at the end as a "catch all"
app.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).sendFile("./views/404.html", { root });
});
```
