# The Global object

---

In the browser, the `window` object is the root object that contains all the structure of a page in the browser, including all the native methods we have in JS (`console.log`, `setTimeOut`, `alert`, `prompt`, etc..)

The window object doesn't exist in Node.js for a very simple reason : we are not inside a browser.

But we have in node a global object that we call... well... `global`

Just like the `window` object, we don't need to call it before a method because it's the root object from which everything exists. Its presence is implied.

Make an experiment :

- Inside a js file you will run with Node, log to the console the object `global`
- See the many methods it contains.
- Some of them are familiar to you like : `setTimeout`, `fetch`...
- Others are completely new : `queueMicrotask`, `atob`, `btoa`

Same as `window`, we don't need to call `global` every time we need to run a native method.

Here are some new properties in the `global` object, we didn't have in the browser :

`__dirname` and `__filename`

Go see what they represent ;)

(Very) Little exercise :

- After three seconds you ran a js file, log to the console the name of the file you are working with. If the file is named `myJs.js`, for example, the result should be the string `myJs`
