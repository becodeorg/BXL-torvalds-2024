# Static Serving

---

You may have realized that if you want to link a css file to an html you are sending as a response, it won't work.

That's because the server protects automatically all our files so the public can't access them, which is a good thing !

To allow the browser to access to something, we have to specify what files (or folder/s) should be allowed to be accessed. In other words : what files should be public.

In order to do that, we can use an express built-in middleware to do that. (ok... I'll tell you its name : `static`)

- Go find the way to create a public folder that contains CSS files and an image so you can link them to an html you are serving.
- Pay attention to the path you should enter when you link a css or an image. (The public folder is considered the root)

FOLDER STRUCTURE EXAMPLE :

app.js
/public
    styles.css
    myImage.jpg
/views
    index.html
```

```js
app.use(express.static("public"));
```

```html
<!-- IN THE INDEX.HTML -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
<!-- Note that the root for the path is the public folder itself because we specified that this folder would be the static one  -->
```
