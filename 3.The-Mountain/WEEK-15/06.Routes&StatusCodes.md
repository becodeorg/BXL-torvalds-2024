# Routes

---

For now, all our request have an unique response. (The one sent in the callback of the `createServer()` method)

But we want to have different responses depending on the url we entered.

Let's create a very basic website that has the home page (`index.html`), an about page (`about.html`) and also a 404 page `404.html`.

- Create them with its respective content.
- In your `server.js`, create the logic that tests the url.
  - If the request was done to the root page (`/`) send the `index.html`, do the same for `about`.
  - If the request was done to another url, send the `404.html`
  - Don't forget to send a status code as well. (`200` for success and `404` for not found)
  - Last thing : if the request is sent to `/about-us` you should redirect to the `/about` url. (don't forget the status code for redirection)

```js
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === "/") {
    fs.readFile("./views/index.html", (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
        res.end();
      } else {
        res.write(data);
        res.statusCode = 200;
        res.end();
      }
    });
  } else if (req.url === "/about") {
    fs.readFile("./views/about.html", (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
        res.end();
      } else {
        res.write(data);
        res.statusCode = 200;
        res.end();
      }
    });
  } else if (req.url === "/about-us") {
    res.setHeader("Location", "/about");
    res.statusCode = 301;
    res.end();
  } else {
    fs.readFile("./views/404.html", (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
        res.end();
      } else {
        res.write(data);
        res.statusCode = 404;
        res.end();
      }
    });
  }
});

server.listen("3000", "localhost", () => {
  console.log("Listening for request on port 3000");
});
```

We can see this is very powerful, but quite verbose ! Ok.. we could have used a `switch` and make the code a little smaller... But it's still not ideal. If your website gets larger and more complex, it can get quite messy and hard to maintain

Fortunately, there is third party package called `express` that can help us manage all of this in a much easier and elegant way.

Now.. we need to understand how to use third party packages in a node application. Enters... NPM !
