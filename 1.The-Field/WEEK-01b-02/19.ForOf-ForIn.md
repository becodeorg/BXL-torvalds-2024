### JavaScripts For... of and For...in

### For... of

A "newish" feature in JavaScript is the loop `for... of`

This allows us to loop over iterable values (like Arrays, strings, etc) without having to deal with the index number.

The for...of loop return automatically the value of the iteration.

While the `for` loop will give you an index that you'll have to use to access the elements of the array (or string, etc.), with the `for... of` you'll get directly the value itself.

```js
const colors = ["red", "orange", "blue", "violet"];

// For loop example

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  console.log(colors[i]);
}

// For... of example

for (let item of colors) {
  console.log(item);
}

// For both, the result will be

/*

"red"
"orange"
"blue"
"violet"

*/
```

Some of you may ask : why use the `for` loop if the `for... of` loop is much easier ?

Well.. I am glad you asked !

Very often, you will NEED the indexes to manipulate the array correctly or to do some logic related to it.

If you just need the values, the `for...of` is perfect. (even though there are other ways with array methods to do the same thing.)

### For...in

`For...of` works only for iterables values. Objects are not iterable because they don't have an order.

A solution is to use `for...in` which has a similar syntax and returns the `keys` of an object. So :

```js
const user = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  hobbies: ["football", "movies", "guitar"],
};

for (let key in user) {
  console.log(key);
}

// Result :

/*
firstName
lastName
age
hobbies
*/
```

So we can easily access the values like this :

```js
for (let key in user) {
  console.log(`${key} : ${user[key]}`);
}

// Result :

/*
firstName : John
lastName : Doe
age : 30
hobbies : ["football", "movies", "guitar"]
*/
```
