Ok then... You're doing great !
Congratulations on arriving this far !

We will now tackle the matter of `methods`.

What are methods ?

Well... they are functions that belong to an object.

Remember an object can hold key/value pairs ?

Well... a function can be such a value. And then it's called a `method` of this object.

```js
const car = {
  color: "blue",
  engine: "75ch",
  doors: 5,
  isTurbo: true,
  drive: function () {
    console.log("Go ahead");
  },
  stop: function () {
    console.log("Stop the car!");
  },
};
```

Here, `drive` and `stop` are methods of the `car` object.

You've heard me saying the word `method` many times during this course. Well... these are functions that belongs to an object.

As I told you sooner, almost everythin in JavaScript are objects. Likewise, `strings` are objects, `arrays` are objects... and even `numbers` behave like objects.

That's why we have `methods` linked to them.

Want a reminder of methods ?

#### Some number methods :

```js
.toExponential()
.toFixed()
.toString()
// etc.
```

#### Some string methods :

```js
.slice()
.trim()
.splice()
.toLowerCase()
.toUpperCase()
// etc.
```

#### Some array methods :

```js
.pop()
.push()
.shift()
.unshift()
.find()
.replace()
// etc.
```

You know we have to chain them with the `dot notation`.

Well... that's exactly how `objects` work !

```js
const myObject = {
  firstName: "Vito",
  lastName: "Corleone",
};

console.log(myObject.firstName);
```

See the `dot notation` to call a value of the object ?

That's what we've been doing since the begin !!!!

```js
const str = "Hello";

str.slice(2, 4);
```

The dot notation to call a method (a function iside the String object), with two parameters.

One more thing : the `this` keyword

If you have an object `user`

```js
const user = {
  fisrtName: "Vito",
  lastName: "Corleone",
};
```

And you want to create a method `printFullName` that takes the `firstName` and `lastName` and concatenates them to log it to the console, you will have to make reference to the object itself. That's done with the `this` keyword.

See an example :

```js
const user = {
  fisrtName: "Vito",
  lastName: "Corleone",
  printFullName: function () {
    console.log("My name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
  },
};
```

The `this` keyword is calling the object itself.

Now, if you call the method `user.printFullName()`, you will get in your console :

`My name is Vito Corleone`

Little exercise :

- Create an object called `user`;
- Give him a `fistName`, a `lastName` and `age`;
- Give him a method `printAge` and `aYearHasPast`
- `aYearHasPast` should add 1 to the age property.
- `printAge` should console.log `(firstName) (lastName) is (age) years old`
- Play in your console to print his age and then increment his age.
