### Conditionals

---

Woooww... that was a nightmare !

But once you grasped the ins and outs of Booleans, Comparison and Logical operators, you are ready to do some very fun stuff in JavaScript !

Now, we are going to see conditionals and implement logic into our code ! Uhuuu !!!!

A conditional syntax in JavaScript is given as follow :

```js
if (boolean) {
  // run this code
} else if (boolean) {
  // run this code
} else {
  // run this code
}
```

Pretty explanatory isn't it ?
So... Let's see if I can enter in a trendy night club this evening :

```js
const name = "Henrique";

let age = 35;

if (age < 18) {
  alert(`Hey ${name}, sorry... you are too young to get in`);
} else if (age > 80) {
  alert(`Come on ${name} ! You are too old ! Get back to sleep !`);
} else {
  alert(`Hey there ${name} ! Enter and make yourself confortable`);
}
```

Can make sense of what is going on here ? In plain english :

If I am under 18, I cannot enter the club. If I am over 80 I am ,apparently, too old to be there. Otherwise, I can enter !

And for each possibility the browser will send a different message !

That's just beautiful, isn't it ?!

There is such a thing called `ternary operators`.
It's a shortcut to do `if else statements`. It translates as such :

```js
// Normal IF ELSE

if (laundry === "dirty") {
  cleanLaundry();
} else {
  watchTv();
}

// With ternary operator :

laundry === "dirty" ? cleanLaundry() : watchTv();
```

To go further, you can learn about the `Switch` statement, which is a way that we can avoid multiple `ifs`. I find it clunky. But it's good to know:
