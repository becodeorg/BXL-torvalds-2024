# Running JavaScript in our browser.

---

JavaScript, as I said, is a programming language that must be executed in order for us to get its results.

We could run it through the terminal thanks to the Node engine (we will see this later) or in our browser. Let's go with this last option.

- First, install the VS Code extension Live Server --> [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

  - This will allow you to open an HTML file we are working on in your browser and see in live all the modifications we do.

- Create in a folder an `index.html` file and a `app.js` file.

- Let's link the js file to your html !

  - In your HTML file, insert this code and save : `<script src="app.js"></script>`

- Then, in your `app.js` insert this line of code : ` alert("Hello there !");`

- Now, go to your browser and check if there is a popup with `Hello there` that appears. If not, there is a problem. If yes, erase the alert in your code and let's keep going !

---

- Now, instead of `alert("Hello there !");`, paste `console.log("I am in the console");`

- In your browser, open the console (F12) or right click and select `inspect`.

- Check the console : your text is there.

- We will be using the console all the time to run and interact with JavaScript.
