### Practice

Given the existing code at the end, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?

`var a = "3";`
`var b = "8";`

The variable `a` shoudl hold the value "8".

And the variable `b` should hold the value "3".

When the code is run, it should output:

`a is 8`

`b is 3`

Copy the bellow code into your javascript file and tun it in the browser.

**Do NOT** change any of the existing code.

You are **NOT allowed** to type any numbers.

Copy this code :

```js
var a = "3";
var b = "8";

/***********Do not change the code above ðŸ‘†*******/
//Write your code here :

/***********Do not change the code below ðŸ‘‡*******/

console.log("a is " + a);
console.log("b is " + b);
```
