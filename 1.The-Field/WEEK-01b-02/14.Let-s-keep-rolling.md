### Let's keep rolling !

Often, we don't visualize yet why we are learning all this... But get assured that all of this is essential for, later, be able to manipulate the DOM (our html page) in the best ways, use React properly, as well as having a strong foundation to configure servers and all that jazz with JavaScript. So keep the hard work !!!

To make a recap of all the material we learned untill now :

### Strings

- How to declare strings (quotes and double quotes)
- Concatenation ("adding" texts together)
- How to declare template literals (backticks and `${}` to insert javascript between text)
- Access specific characters inside of a string (width indexes)
- The property `length`
- The methods :
  - .slice()
  - .replace()
  - .toUpperCase()
  - .toLowerCase()
  - .indexOf()
  - .lastIndexOf()
  - .trim()
  - transform a string into an array : split()

### Numbers

- Know what are `integers` and `floats`
- Do basic arithmetic operations with numbers (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`)
- Convert strings into numbers (`parseFloat()`, `parseInt()`)
- Convert numbers into strings (`.toString()`)
- Fix tha amount of decimals for a float (`toFixed()`)
- Using the Math object and its methods :
  - round
  - floor
  - ceil
  - random
- Generate a random number between a range using the `random` Math method.

### Booleans and comparison

- The comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<=`, `>=`, `<==`, `>==`)
- The logical operators
  - AND `&&`
  - OR `||`
  - NOT `!`
- The fact that an expression with comparison operators always returns a boolean.
- How to interprete logical operations. (`true && false` return false for example)

### Conditions

- The syntax of the IF/ELSE conditional operation
- Ternary operator (`thruthy ? action : action if falsy`)
  And, if you were curious :
- The syntax of the Switch statement

### Arrays

- What Arrays are (a collection of ordered data)
- How to create and array (declare a variable with `[]` and separate items with comma `,`)
- How to check its length (.length)
- How to add / replace elements in an array
- The methods :
  - Pop and Push
  - Shift and unshift
  - Concat
  - Join
  - Split (which is a **STRING** method that transforms a string into an array)
  - Slice
  - Splice
  - Reverse
  - Sort
  - Includes

### Objects

- What objects are
- How to create an objects with properties
- How to access object properties
- How to create extra properties in an objects.
- How to modify a property
- Know that an array of objects will be a pattern for SO many situations you will encounter

We will contine with JavaScript and will learn the following concepts :

### Loops

- For loops
- Looping over arrays
- While loop
- For... of loop
- For... in loop

### Functions

- Functions, parameters...
- The concepts of `return`
- Scope
- Methods (functions inside an object)
- The keyword "this"

### Array methods with callbacks

- Foreach
- Map
- Arrow functions
- setTimeOut and setInterval
- filter
- some
- every
- reduce

### Miscellaneous

- Spread
  - In functions
  - In arrays
  - In objects
- Rest
- Destructuring
