# Null and Undefined

---

`null` and `undefined` are two data types we encounter in JS.

`undefined` means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.

```js
let myVariable;
/* Here we declared a variable but without giving it a value. We can give it a value later. */
```

`null` means an empty value or a blank value.

So, for example, you declare that the variable `let myVariable = null`.

Later on we can assign it to something else.

It can be quite confusing... It looks like thery are almost the same. It's more interesting as a return value in order to have more information. Don't worry too much about that for now.

Just know that they have both "empty" values.

There is another value we can get in return is : `NaN` which stands for `Not A Number`;

Very easy to understand : if I multiply `53 * "hello"`, JavaScript can't handle this. Because of the multiplication it should be a number but it's not. It returns then `NaN`
