#### Arrow functions

Let me introduce you to `arrow functions`.

We saw already how to declare a function :

```js
function myFunc() {
  // code
}
```

We even saw that functions are stored in variables given by its name and therefore we could declare a function like that :

```js
const myFunc = function () {
  // code
};
```

Well... there is another - very handy - way to declare a function which is called the `arrow function`.

It's like that :

```js
const myFunc = () => {
  // code
};
```

The `arrow function` because... well... we use an arrow `=>` in its declaration.

And alos, we can have an implicit return :

Instead of returning with the keyword `return`, we can just return something between parenthesis.

And **_if it's in one line_** - we can just point with the arrow to what is returned.

Examples. These are the same thing :

```js
function addOne(num) {
  return num + 1;
}

const addOne = (num) => {
  return num + 1;
};

const addOne = (num) => num + 1;
```

Practical isn't it ?!

Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/Oy185MF8pnY?si=IwK6w5qxzIjyPdgm) and learn about something we didn't cover here : the use of the keyword `this` in arrow functions.

#### Anonymous functions

That's what we call a function that has not a name and therefore will be called just in a particular moment, in a particular context.

In a `higher order function` - a function or method that has a function as a parameter, we could use such an anonymous function

We'll see this in the next article, when we'll talk about callback ;)

#### Callback functions

Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a `callback function`. (Simplilearn)

Why Am I talking about this ?

Because in the next article we will start to study Array methods with callbacks.

If you didn't get it yet, you'll do very soon in the next article ;)
