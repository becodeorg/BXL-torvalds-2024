### Booleans, Comparison and Logical Operators

---

#### Booleans

Ok... nothing too fancy here...

The boolean datatype is composed by two values : either `true` or `false`.

They are the easiest and one of the most used data type.

They are writen in lowercase as such :

```js
let isAwaken = true;

// Later we can change it...

isAwaken = false;
```

Ok... but why are these usefull ?

Usually, we get these values by comparing different values and then it returns a boolean (true or false). And receiving this result of a comparison is crucial to make decision in JavaScript. (Decide if we are going to run one piece of code instead of another).

How can we compare two values then ?

#### Comparison

Tha main comparison operators are :

- more than `>`
- less than `<`
- equals to `==` (independent of data type. So `4 == "4"` is true.)
- strictly equals to `===` (dependant of data type. So `4 === "4"` is false)
- not equal to `!=`
- strictly not equals to `!==`
- more than or equal to `>=`
- less than or equal to `<=`
- strictly more than or equal to `>==`
- strictly less than or equal to `<==`

So for example :

```js
let a = 1;

let b = 3;

console.log(a < b); // Prints true
console.log(a === b); // Prints false
```

You see ? When you put a comparison operator it automatically returns a boolean, either it's true or false.

Try this :

```js
let a = 3 > 5;

console.log(a); // Prints false
```

You are defining the variable `a` as a boolean ! As soon as you put a comparison operator between two values, you are expecting a boolean.

#### Logical Operators

We call logical operators some conditions we give to a comparison.

For example :

```js
const a = 3;

const b = 17;

const c = 22;

const d = 22;
```

I know I can compare the variables `a` and `b` to see which one is greater thant the other. I could just do :

```js
a < b; // Returns true
```

But what if I also want to check, AT THE SAME TIME, if `c` and `d` are equals ?

My condition would be, in plain English : _"I want to know if `a` is less than `b` **AND** `c` equals to `d`"_.

Only in the case both are true it will satisfy my requirements.

So... this little **_And_** I put in my sentence is a `logical operator`.

There are three of them :

- AND `&&`
- OR `||`
- NOT `!`

And I can chain them :

```js
10 > 5; // Returns true

10 > 5 && 8 < 3; // Returns false
```

Why this last one returns false ?

Because the first part of the comparison is `true` but the second one is `false`.
With my **_AND_**, I demanded that both should be true. Thus: the result is `false`.

It's like saying :

```js
true && false; // Returns false
```

Ouuufff.... Take a second and breathe !

Here are some combinations and their results. Ask yourself if you get it...

```js
true && true; // returns true

true && false; // returns false

false && false; // returns false

true || false; // returns true (because we demanded that at least one of them was true)

!true; // returns false (because we are saying that we want the opposite of the original value)
```

Little exercise :

- Try to find if the below expressions return true or false (check at the end of the page the results).
  Tip : Analyze it by chunks.

```js
// question A
true && !false;

// question B
false && true;

// question C
!false && !false;

// question D
5 > 3 && !(2 > 1);

// question E
true && !(1 == "1");

// question F
5 !== "5" || false;
```

Did you cheat with the console ?
Well.. You've should !! The console is an awesome way to test and see the results. Little by little you'll get it !!!!

Ok... stay with me ! We're almost done !
Let's dive into `falsy and thruty values`

There are some values that, in a comparison, are always considered false. These are :

- the value `false` (duh!!!)
- an empty string `""`
- `undefined`
- `null`
- `NaN` (Not A Number)
- the number `0`

Any other value is considered `truthy`

What does that mean in practice ?

```js
true && undefined; // returns false
```

This returns false because, in a comparison, `undefined` is considered `false`. That's why we call it a `falsy` value.

Try to solve these four questions :

```js
// QUESTION 1
!0 && true;

// QUESTION 2
const a = null;
const b = undefined;
const c = 4;

(!a && b) || c;

// QUESTION 3

a == b && c;

// QUESTION 4

!b && "Hello" && c;
```

**After this section, you should know :**

- The comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<=`, `>=`, `<==`, `>==`)
- The logical operators
  - AND `&&`
  - OR `||`
  - NOT `!`
- The fact that an expression with comparison operators always returns a boolean.
- How to interprete logical operations. (`true && false` return false for example)
