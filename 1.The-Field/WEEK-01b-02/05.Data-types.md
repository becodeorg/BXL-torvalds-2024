# Javascript Data Types

---

Ok, we saw that in JavaScript we work with values as data. But what sort of data (values) there are ? That's what we call `data types`. The types of data Javascript can handle, understand and manipulate.

Before we continue, here is an operator we can use : `typeof`
It will return de type of the value/variable you put just after.

```js
let num1 = 57;

typeof num1; // returns number

////

let name = "Henrique";

typeof name; // returns string
```

---

The data types we work with the most in JS are :

- Strings
- Numbers
- Null / Undefined
- Booleans
- Arrays (which are objects actually, but don't worry about this for now)
- Objects

Ok... there are two more, but we only use them after years and years of experience. Let's not complicate ;)
