### Exercise

---

Let's make a todo list that works only in the terminal with what we've learned so far.

Instructions :

- When the user enters the page, tha machine should ask him to write down a command :
  - `new` to add a todo
  - `list` to see all the todos
  - `delete` to remove a specific todo
  - `quit` to exit de program
- Use the `prompt()` function to ask what they want to perform.

- If the user choses `new`, prompt again to write what is the todo. When added, log to the console that the todo was added to the list.
- If the user choses `list`, log to the console all the todos he has inserted. It should look like this :

```
********* TODO LIST *********
1. Walk out the dog
2. Drink some milk
3. Learn JavaScript
4. Make exercises
etc...
```

- If the user choses `delete`, prompt what is the number of the todo and delete the todo
- If the user choses `quit`, break the loop.

- The user should be able to add as many todos he wants and , each time he choses `list`, be, able to see all of them.

TIPS :

- Use an array to store the todos and to log them to the console when we ask to `list`
- Keep in mind that the listing of the todos should begin with 1 (after all, we are not machines that start with 0)
- The whole app should live inside a loop that only breaks when we choose "quit".
- Use methods like splice()
- Use the concept of `falsy` values
