### But, what is Javascript ?

**Javascript** is a programming language that can be executed by the browser.

Actually, Javascript is the **ONLY** programming language that can be executed by the browser.

HTML and CSS are read and interpreted by the browser, but they are not a programming language (that contains logical operations and executions).

### Why do we need it ?

HTML and CSS are static content that we deliver to a browser. Javascript is the only way we have to change the page dynamically without changing the original html and css files.

### Application and use cases

Among many other things, here is a little list of certain application and use cases of javascript in the frontend field :

- Update displayed data behind the scenes (ex: weather data, stocks data, chat messages, etc.) (_That's what happens in all weather and live stock websites_)
- Display or use a timer. (_Think of a bank website that shows you how long you've been connected_)
- Validate user inputs and show error message with specific styling to the element.
- You can reorder, hide / show or remove elements on the screen (_Think of drag-and-drop lists_)

But ! (there is always a but...) Before we start doing amazing things with JavaScript, we need to really **understand how Javascript works and how to think logically as a programmer**.

Are you ready ??
Let's go !!!!
