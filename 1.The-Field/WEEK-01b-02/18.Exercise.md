### Javascript Loop Exercise

---

Ok, let's write a little stupid game. :)
Read all the instructions before starting to code.

- The machine should ask the user to enter a "max number".
- Get sure the max number is indeed a number. Otherwise it should ask again tha max number.
- The machine should then choose a random number between 1 and the max number.
- Then, the machine will ask the user to guess the number
- If we enter something that is not a number, the machine should alert it's not a valid answer and ask again for a number.
- If it's not correct, the machine should tell it's not correct and if the guess should be higher or lower.
- The loop ends only when the user finds the number and then the machine says "Congratulation!" and how many attemps the user made before it guessed right.

Little tip :

- The prompt function always return a string. Even if you put a number. Make sure you compare numbers to numbers ;)
- We can not use a comparator with NaN. There is a function to check if it's NaN : `isNaN()`. But remember : NaN is falsy, so there are better ways.
