# JavaScript Curriculum

---

We are going to deep dive into the wonderful world of JavaScript. Here below you can find a list of the topics we will study.

The strategy here is to arrive as soon as possible at the end of each module, and then come back for a second layer of understanding with some more complex content.

### What we will see in this first JS module (7 days) :

- Variables
- Data types

  - Strings

    - property (length)
    - methods

  - Numbers

    - operators
    - the Math object

  - Null and Undefined

  - Booleans

- Conditionals

  - If Else
  - Switch

- Data types (continuation)

  - Arrays
    - methods
    - reference type
    - multidimensional arrays
  - Objects

- Loops

  - for
  - while
  - for in
  - for of

- Functions

About videos...

There is this very nice [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7TLF4T4Tq2TtNmadzRfxYIB9683uhpbD) with a very solid course on JavaScript. The only problem is that it takes aproximatively 8 hours to follow it from start to finish. But each video is aproximativaly 8-10 minutes for a specifc topic. So don't hesitate to cherry pick the videos you want about what you want. (The content it covers will be seen in two/three weeks, so it can be watched little by little)

Try to only watch the parts you just finished reading and doing exercises.
