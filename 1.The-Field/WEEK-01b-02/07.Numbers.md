### Numbers

---

AAAAhhhhhh numbers...
So many usecases for it !

`Numbers` in JavaScript are... numbers ! Integers or decimals. It doesn't matter. It's `numbers` !

With them, you can do all mathematic operations and logic.

```js
typeof 5; // Returns number

typeof 7.34659; // Returns number

typeof "17"; // Returns string

let myNumber = 79;

typeof myNumber; // Returns number
```

You can do all kind of math operations with numbers

```js
5 + 7; // Returns 12

3 * 6; // Returns 18

6 / 3; // Returns 2

19 - 7; // Returns 12

2 ** 2; // (2 by the power of 2) Returns 4

2 ** 4; // (2 by the power of 4) Returns 16

5 % 2; // (remainder of the division of 5 / 2) Returns 1

////

let num1 = 4;

let num2 = 12;

(num1 + num2) / 2; // Returns 8
```

We also have the Math object (we will understand why it's called like that later) that has many usefull methods :

```js
// Math.round. Rounds automatically the number to its nearest integer.

Math.round(8.15); // Return 8

Math.round(8.76); // Returns 9

// Math.floor. Rounds it to the lower integer.

Math.floor(8.9); // Returns 8

// Math.ceil. Rounds it to the higher integer.

Math.ceil(3.1); // Returns 4
```

Exercise :

- Go look how can we get a random number in JS !
  - You will have to use another Math method : random.
  - Get to really understand how the `random()` method works. [Watch this](https://youtu.be/UZqSpuUJPa0?si=akl6oqPv7rsMqG85) (only the first 1min50)
- Generate a random integer between 0 and 10
- Generate a random float between 1 and 5

---

A number method :

```js
// toFixed

let myNumber = 5.379453;

myNumber.toFixed(2); // Returns 5.37
```

---

JavaScript is also smart enough to detect your string can be a number.

If you do :

```js
5 * "3"; // Returns 15
```

This is called `type coercion`. JavaScript understands that the 3 represents a number and makes the math automatically.

BUT !!!

If you add 2 strings, even if they represent numbers, you'll get a concatenation of these two strings :

```js
"3" + "54"; // Returns "354"
```

---

There is a way to convert a string to a number :

```js
// parseFloat

let myString = "4.786";

parseFloat(myString); // Returns 4.786 (the number, not the string)

// ParseInt

parseInt(myString); // Returns 4
```

And vice-versa :

```js
let num = 54;

num.toString(); // Returns "54" (the string, not the number)
```

---

#### Assignment operators

Often, we will want to update a variable that contains a number.

For example, I want to turn my variable `num` from `1` to `2`.

The most basic way to do it is to reassign it using the variable itself :

```js
let num = 1;

num = num + 1;
```

As it's something we'll do very often, a shortcut to do it is :

```js
num += 1; // that means we will add 1 to the num

num += 4; // Now it returns 6 (because we already had add one to it)
```

And you can do this with all other operators.
Try to find what value muNum will have after the below lines of code :

```js
let myNum = 0;

myNum += 4;

myNum -= 2;

myNum /= 2;

myNum *= 10;
```

We can go even further ! Because adding 1 is so common, instead of putting `num += 1`, we can just type : `num++`

---

That was a quick grasp at numbers.

**After this section, you should know :**

- Know what are `integers` and `floats`
- Do basic arithmetic operations with numbers (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`)
- Convert strings into numbers (`parseFloat()`, `parseInt()`)
- Convert numbers into strings (`.toString()`)
- Fix the amount of decimals for a float (`toFixed()`)
- Using the Math object and its methods :
  - round
  - floor
  - ceil
  - random
- Generate a random number between a range using the `random` Math method.
