### Data type : Objects

---

Wow! Pay attention to this one !!!!

**Objects** are the very essence of JavaScript !

---

Just like arrays, `objects` are what we call a `data structure` => a collection of values.

But while arrays are a collection of **ordered** values, objects don't work like that. We structure objects with what we call `key/value pairs`.

Objects are a collection of properties, identified by custom keys like you can see above : (by the way, that's how we declare an object, with curly braces `{}`)

```js
const myObject = {
  firstName: "Henrique",
  age: 35,
  isMarried: true,
  hasChildren: true,
};
```

Here, `name` is a key and `"Henrique"` is the value connected to `name`. They form a `key-value pair`, and we call that a `property`.

The order of the `properties` doesn't matter.
The same object could be :

```js
const myObject = {
  isMarried: true,
  firstName: "Henrique",
  hasChildren: true,
  age: 35,
};
```

It wouldn't change a thing.

---

We won't enter in details right now, but almost everything in JavaScript is an object. Heard of `arrays` ? Well... arrays are objects. Heard of the `Math` object ? It's an object (duh!). Have you heard of the DOM (All the HTML structure that we will be manipulating ?) It works like an object !

---

In an object, we can give anything as a value : strings, numbers, booleans, arrays... and even other objects :

```js
const myObject = {
  username: "trigorin88", //string
  downVotes: 19, //number
  upVotes: 214, //number
  netScore: 195, //number
  commentText: "Tastes like chicken. lol !", //string
  tags: ["#hillarious", "#funny", "#silly"], //array
  isApproved: true, //boolean
  imgSrc: {
    thumbnail: "https://images.com/lnhj64225JG/200",
    medium: "https://images.com/lnhj64225JG/600",
    original: "https://images.com/lnhj64225JG/original",
  }, // object
};
```

---

#### Accessing objects properties

To access objects properties, we can use two methods : `brackers` or `dot notation`;

Look at this :

```js
const user = {
  firstName: "Henrique",
  age: 35,
  isMarried: true,
  hasChildren: true,
  children: [
    {
      firstName: "Eva",
      age: 2,
    },
  ],
};

// I can acess the firstName like so :

user["firstName"]; // Returns "Henrique" - Bracket method

user.firstName; // Returns "Henrique" - Dot notation method

// I can also chain things. Let's say I want to select the first element of the children array and select the age property :

user.children[0].age; // Returns 2
```

One very important thing to know about the bracket method : **It has to be a string**! If you put `user[firstName]`, without quotes, it will look for a variable called `firstName` (which can be quite usefull some times and it's a thing we can't do with the dot notation).

**Our First Object Exercise**

It's time to practice creating your own object literal. Please define a new variable called product. It should be an object literal with the following properties:

name - set to the string "iPhone 15"

inStock - set to the boolean true

price - set to the number 1249.90

includedInPackage - set to an array of at least three strings like ["case", "earphones", "charger"]

Now, log to the console the second item included in the package that this iPhone product comes with.

---

**Object Access Exercise**

- Your task to is to create a variable named `fullAddress` that points to a string using the information from `restaurant`.

- `fullAddress` should point to a string that includes the address, city, state, and zipcode from the `restaurant` object. Make sure to add any necessary commas or spaces between the values as seen in the exact expected output format shown below.

- To make it harder to "cheat" by copy and pasting, I've randomly generated the address portion.
  - For example, if address was "64 Johnson Ave", the `fullAddress` variable would look like this:

`"64 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206" // this is the expected output format of the fullAddress string (keep an eye on the commas and/or spaces between the values and match that too!)`

- Finally, log to the console the value of `fullAdress`

```js
//PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THIS LINE!
const restaurant = {
  name: "Ichiran Ramen",
  address: `${Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1} Johnson Ave`,
  city: "Brooklyn",
  state: "NY",
  zipcode: "11206",
};

//YOUR CODE GOES DOWN HERE:
```

#### Modifying and adding properties

You can change an object property value just to reassigning it :

```js
const movie = {
  title: "Braveheart",
  year: 1995,
  director: "Mel Gipson",
  genre: ["action", "drama"],
  rating: 92,
};

console.log(movie.rating); // Prints 92

movie.rating = 97;

console.log(movie.rating); // Prints 97
```

What if I want to add another property to the `movie` object ?

```js
movie.budget = 53.000.000

console.log(movie);

// Prints :

/*
{
  title: "Braveheart",
  year: 1995,
  director: "Mel Gipson",
  genre: ["action", "drama"],
  rating: 92,
  budget: 53.000.000
}
*/
```

Small comment :
Do you realize how Arrays work like objects ? The only thing is that the keys of an array are 0, 1, 2, etc... And they are presented in numerical order.

#### Nesting Arrays & Objects

As we saw, you can have properties in an object that are arrays or even an object itself.

In the other side, you can have `arrays of objects` as well. And this is a very common pattern that we will use all the time, for example with APIs.

Here is a typical response from an API call :

```js
// We get an array of objects that list many movies with its characteristics

const movies = [
  {
    title: "Braveheart",
    year: 1995,
    director: "Mel Gipson",
  },
  {
    title: "Goodfellas",
    year: 1990,
    director: "Martin Scorsese",
  },
  {
    title: "The Godfather",
    year: 1972,
    director: "Francis Ford Coppola",
  },
  {
    title: "Annie Hall",
    year: 1977,
    director: "Woody Allen",
  },
];
```

You can access a particular movie with :

```js
movies[2].title; // Returns "The Godfather"
```

Very soon, we will see how to loop through this array and extract all the data we need !

And also : after seeing functions, we will get to know what `object methods` are.
