### JavaScripts Loops

---

Loops are the way we repeat fonctionnalities in our code.

So, instead of having to have the same thing happened 10 times in a row and having to write it down 10 times, I can put them in a loop that automatically will repeat this task.

That could be something very simple :

- Print "hello" 10 times in the console
- Sum all the numbers in an array
  ...

Sum up numbers in an array could be pretty simple... if I have 4-5 numbers. But it could be 10.000 numbers ! We must automate this kind of task !

There are multiple types of loop :

- for loop
- while loop
- for... of loop
- for... in loop

Example of loop :

Imagine a trendy post on Facebook. There are hundreds of comments on this post. For sure these comments are contained in an array. In this array we'll have then hundreds of objects containing the content of the comment, the date it was done, the author of it, etc.

These comments have to be displayed. Let's say that in order to display them we need 10 lines of code for each one. Does that mean we have to write more thant a thousand lines of code ? Of course not ! A loop containing the 10 lines of code will repeat hundreds of time, each time displaying one comment.
