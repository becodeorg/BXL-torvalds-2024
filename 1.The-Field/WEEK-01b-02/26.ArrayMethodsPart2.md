# Array methods part 2

---

**OOOOOOkkkkk !!**

I understand that the last article was about some weird concepts we don't understand exactly why we are studying them. But we are going to make sense of it right now !

---

We already saw the concept of `methods` : Functions inside an object that can be called.

We also saw that `Arrays` (as almost everything else in JavaScript) are `objects` and contain `methods` that can be applied to our array.

There are many and many Array methods. And this is very good because Arrays are a **crucial** part of programming with JavaScript !

Let's remember some `Array methods` we've already seen :

```js
myArray.push();
myArray.pop();
myArray.shift();
myArray.unshift();
myArray.concat();
myArray.includes();
myArray.indexOf();
myArray.join();
myArray.split();
myArray.reverse();
myArray.slice();
myArray.sort();
```

Not recognizing one of these ? Go look for it !

---

All these methods take either _no parameter_ or some numbers/string.

We are going to see now the much more powerful Array methods that take a function as parameter !

### forEach()

`forEach()` is a method that takes an anonymous function as parameter. What it does is :

- It loops through the array and run the anonymous function for each element of the array.

For example :

```js
const myArray = ["hello", "goodbye", "see you later"];

myArray.forEach(function (element) {
  console.log(element);
});
```

Result in the console :

```
"hello"
"goodbye"
"see you later"
```

Pretty handy isn't it ? We don't have to do `for loops` to loop through an array now.

Try to understand what's happening :

- the method `forEach` (which is a function of the Array object), loops through all elements of `myArray`.
- For each element of this array, an anonymous function that we write inside of the parenthesis of the forEach, will take the `element` (call it what you want) and will perform what exists inside the anonymous function.

Important to know : the `forEach` method doesn't return anything. If you try to capture it in a variable it won't do a thing !

That leads us to another
very handy and similar method :

### map()

`map()` works exactly like forEach with some differences :

It loops through the array and apply the anonymous function to each element, but the anonymous function should return something. This value returned will be a new element in a new array.

So the map method returns a new array with each "transformed" element.

Example :

```js
const firstArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const newArray = firstArray.map((element) => {
  return element * 5;
});

// Now, let's see :

console.log(firstArray);
console.log(newArray);
```

Result in the console :

```
[1,2,3,4,5]
[5,10,15,20,25]
```

See ? We created a new array with some data processing in the process.

Now, go look for these essential methods :

`filter()`
`find()`
`some()`
`every()`
`sort()` Wait a minute... we already saw this one. But now see it with callback functions.
`reduce()` Don't worry if you don't get this one yet. It's quite complicate.
