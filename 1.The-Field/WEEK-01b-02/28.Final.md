# JavaScript Foundamentals is over !

---

Before we say goodbye, here are some topics that you might have overlooked during the JavaScript path that I strongly recommend you to give it another chance :

- Are you confident with the term of `reference types` (for arrays and objects, for example) ?
- Are you confident with the notion of `falsy`, `thruthy` ?
- Are you confident with the boolean operations ? The NOT `!` for example ?
- Are you confident with the `ternary operator` ?
- Are you confident with the `arrow functions` ?
- Are you confident with the Array methods (map, filter, ...)?

Now, you can come [here](./ALGOS-serie1/) and find your first algorithm exercises to solve.

The next two weeks will have more complex ones. So buckle up !
