## Exercise : Conditionals

---

Ok... Let's practice !

You will write a little program that, when the user enters the browser, it prompts some questions about the user.

- name
- which do you prefer, cats or dogs ?

Then, the browser should greet the user and make a comment about cats if he prefers cats or dogs if he prefers dogs.

Now, let's pimp it up !

Follow the instructions for this next exercise. You will have to check your console to have the result.

```js
const mystery = ""; //CHANGE THIS VALUE TO MAKE THE CONDITIONAL BELOW TRUE

// LEAVE THIS CODE ALONE! (pretty please)
if (mystery[0] === "P" && mystery.length > 5 && mystery.indexOf("7") !== -1) {
  console.log("YOU GOT IT!!!");
} else {
  console.log("TRY AGAIN");
}
```

**Make a keyless car!**
This car will only let you drive if you are over 18. Make it do the following:

using prompt() and alert(), ask a user for their age.

IF they say they are below 18, respond with:
"Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off"

IF they say they are 18, respond with:
"Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!"

IF they say they are over 18, respond with:
"Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"

**What fruit?**

- Ask the user what is his favorite fruit.
  - If it's `bananas`, tell him you like bananas as well.
  - If it's `strawberry`, tell him you LOVE strawberries.
  - If it's `grape`, aks him if he prefers purple or green grapes.
    - If it's `purple`, tell him you don't like purple grapes.
    - If it's `green`, tell him green grapes are ok...
    - If it's not purple or green, tell him you don't understand.
  - If it's another thing, tell him you don't understand the word he said (displaying the word he said).

Think like a programmer !

- DRY !!!!! (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- What if the person puts `Bananas` instead of `bananas` ?
- Try to think the more efficient way to get to your goal.
