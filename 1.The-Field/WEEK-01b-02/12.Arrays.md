### Data type : Arrays.

---

Ok, so... We saw some very important data types already :

- Strings
- Numbers
- Null and Undefined
- Booleans

This next one is very important : **Arrays**.

Arrays are a collection of values (data-structure).

Let's say I need to capture the names of the Beatles in variables. That means I'll have to create a variable for each one.

```js
const bassist = "Paul";
const guitarist = "John";
const drummer = "Ringo";
const compositor = "George";
```

With more and more variables in our program, we will end up with tons of variables all over the place !

It's easier to have a collection of "values" inside just ONE variable.

That's what **Arrays** are for.

```js
const beatles = ["Paul", "John", "Ringo", "George"];
```

I could just have one variable and many methods to access and manipulate these values.

- The list of comment on an Instagram post
- Collection of levels in a game
- Songs in a Spotify playlist
- The list of students that are in the Hopper group inside of my.becode...

All of these are arrays !

Ordered collection of data.

So how to create an array ? Pretty simple :

```js
// To make an empty array
const students = [];

// An array of strings
const colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow"];

// An array of numbers
const lottoNumbers = [19, 22, 56, 12, 51];

// A mixed array
const stuff = [true, 68, "cat", null];
```

### How to access a value in an array ?

Do you remember how to access particular characters in a string ? It's the same thing !

```js
const colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow"];

colors[0]; // returns "orange"
colors[1]; // returns "red"
colors[2]; // returns "yellow"

colors[3]; // returns undefined (it doesn't exist)
```

### How to add a value into an array ?

Because there is no colors[3], we could declare like this =

```js
colors[3] = "purple";

// now, "colors" is :

["orange", "red", "yellow", "purple"];

// you can also change a value reassigning it :

colors[1] = "I'am a new value";

// now, "colors" is :

["orange", "I'am a new value", "yellow", "purple"];

// We substituted "red" by "I'am a new value"
```

Ok.. we know now how to add an element to an array by selecting the last + 1 index but... What if we don't know what is the last index of an array ? Well... like strings, we can look for the `length` of the array.

So :

```js
const colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "purple"];
////////////////// 0 ////// 1 ////// 2 ////// 3

colors.length; // Returns 4

// We could just do :

colors[colors.lenght] = "new color";

console.log(colors); // prints ["orange", "red", "yellow", "purple", "new color"]
```

Ok... But there's gotta be a better way ! And.. YES there is !

### The wonderful world of Array methods

`Array methods` are native functions that arrays can execute to add/remove/change/filter/scan... its content.

They are awesome !!! We can do so much with them !

There are a lot of methods. You don't have to know everything. But there is still a lot to remember.

See here the [list](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/library/array) of all array methods.

And [here](http://js-review.widopanel.com/) is a little cheat sheet I made myself.

We will visit a lot of them and hopefully, with time, you'll understand why they are so awesome ! (When we'll work with external APIS, all the results are given through arrays... wait for it !)

Two more things :

Look up on the internet for the concept of `reference type` and understand why we can not copy an array just doing this :

```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const mySecondArray = myArray; // this won'nt copy the array into a new variable
```

Second thing :

Did you know you can have what we call multiple dimensional arrays ? That's having an array as an array element.

```js
const myArray = [null, true, ["apple", "strawberry", "lemon", "banana"]];

// You can access an element of the array inside the array as such :

myArray[2][1]; // Returns "straweberry"
```

Watch these videos :

- [How to use Arrays](https://youtu.be/K97CmrUFyQY?si=nZhtxomVNWmyxoEK) (11 min)
- [Array methods](https://youtu.be/0m3lBRVSTH8?si=8Sfi99Qh3Y_D2Ns-) (20 min **MANDATORY**)

This last video tackles the most basic methods.
Other methods, more complex and important, will come when we'll see **_Functions_**

In my [array methods little website](http://js-review.widopanel.com/), ignore the methods with `callbacks` for now.
