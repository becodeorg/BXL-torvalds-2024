# UTILITY

---

Now that you know how Git and Github work, let's do the following :

- Each one of you will create a personal repo in your account called `[BECODE-YOURNAME]` where all your exercises will be pushed so I am able to check them and eventually give you some feedback.

- You can make it private and grant access to me (`VieiraHenrique`) as an Admin. So only you and me will be able to check your repo.

- When doing exercises, always create folders named accordingly to my course stucture, so I can know exactly which exercise it is. Ex: `/WEEK-01b-02/04b.Practice/` and create your html, js files in there.

This will mostly be handy to me during the first month with the JavaScript exercises.
But I am sure it will help you keep organized with all your advancements.

Let's start JavaScript ? :D
