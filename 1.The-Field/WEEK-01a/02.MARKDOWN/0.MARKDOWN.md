# My First Markdown Page

## Mission objectives

Today is a _BIG_ day! You're about to learn your first Markup language.

But what is a markup Language? That's a question you should be able to answer at the end of this challenge.

In this challenge you are expected to create a `Readme.md` page that explains who you are, what you like and what you want to achieve and your ideas and projects.

##### What do you need to complete this challenge?

- A text editor of your choice to save your work. (come on... VSCODE !!!!)
- An online tool that'll help you visualize the output of your makdown file. I recommend [this one](https://dillinger.io/) (if you have VSCode, there is an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) to visualize it directly in the code editor )
- Some documentation about Markdown Syntax. [this is good ;)](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- An Ounce of creativity.

## Learning objectives

- _IT FUNDAMENTALS_
  - Use a lightweight markup language

### Must-have features

- A title with your name and your occupation
- A first paragraph explaining who you are (no need to get too serious! :))
- A list of your three most surprising skills
- A list of the three things you like the most in this universe.
- The objectives you want to achieve as a developer during Becode.
- The fears you might have.
- The things you look forward to.
- The three things you value the most in working as a team
- Your favorite GIF

### Nice-to-have features

- Be creative. Try to push the markdown syntax to its limits!

### Miscellaneous information

You will work in an online editor like the one I suggested above.

Once your work is done, do not forget to take your markdown code and paste it in your text editor to be able to save it. (or if you are alredy doing it in VSCode, just forget this line :P)

One saved, you can go ahead and either get deeper into markdown with the videos provided bellow, either tackling tomorrow's content (the terminal)
