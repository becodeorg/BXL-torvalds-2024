## THE TERMINAL

For a long time, the _terminal_ (or _command line_) was the only way for humans to communicate with computers.

Until the 1980's, it was how we gave instructions to a computer.

Nowadays, with _operating systems_ like Windows, MacOS, etc., we have a graphic visualization (the GUI : _Graphical User Interface_) of what there is on the computer and ways to dynamically interact with it.

However, the terminal still exists and is crucial for the developer's work.

### If we can use the GUI, why use the terminal ?

**1 . SPEED : Develop Faster !**

The terminal takes some getting used to, but it can be MUCH faster than using a GUI.

**2 . ACCESS**

The terminal provides a ‚Äúmainline‚Äù into the heart of our computer, giving us access to areas we normally don't interact with.

**3 . TOOLS**

Many of the tools we need are installed and used via the command line. We don't have much of a choice!

### First things first‚Ä¶

You'll hear lots of terms concerning the terminal. _Terminal, Shell, Command Line, Console, Bash‚Ä¶_ Let's dive into what they mean.

**Terminal / Command Line / Console**

For now, we can say these are the same thing. Which is :

"A text-based interface to your computer. Originally a physical object, but now we use software terminals.

**Shell**

The program running on the terminal

**Bash**

Bash is a specific program for a terminal. (There are others, like ZSH, PowerShell, etc.).

So‚Ä¶ **Bash** is a **shell**, which is the program running on the **terminal**.

### Second things second‚Ä¶

Set up your machine in order to begin our terminal manipulations.

If you have **Linux** (Ubuntu): good for you! Everything will work just fine.

If you have a **Mac**: most commands will work fine, but for some you will need to search for a Mac-specific alternative. Google is your friend üòâ

If you have **Windows 10 / 11**: Install the [GIT Bundle](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and it will come with a Git Bash terminal. Most commands will work fine. Some might need Windows-specific alternatives. Google is your friend üòâ
