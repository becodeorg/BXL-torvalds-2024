## THE TERMINAL : Challenges

### Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge, you should be able to:

- Get to know where you are on the computer `pwd`
- Navigate through your computer directories (folders) back and forward `cd`
- See the folders and files `ls` in the present folder
- Create new directories (folders) `mkdir`
- Create new files `touch`
- Delete files `rm` and folders
- Create multiple directories and files in one shot
- Use flags to pimp up your terminal commands (search what are flags and how they are crucial to a good usage of the terminal)
- Get back home if you are lost. `cd ~`
- Get to read the manual of commands `man` or `help`

Come on… I've already been very generous with my tips... But there are more commands ! Now go look up how to solve the challenge. Google is your friend 😉

### The challenge

Enter the terminal and then **DON'T TOUCH the mouse anymore**.

- Print your location on the screen
- Print the content of your current directory
- Print the content of `/`
- Move to the folder `/bin`
- Print your new location
- Go back to your home folder

Everything OK so far ? Let's keep rolling !

- Go to the desktop
- Print the content of your current directory
- Create a folder called “animals"
- Inside the folder, create 5 folders at once : “dog", “cat”, “wolf”, “apple” and “elephant”.
- Enter each folder and create a file “file.txt”
- Get back to the animals folder

Oh snap ! “apple” is not an animal ! 😁

- Remove the folder “apple” (you'll probably get an error. Try to get help from the terminal to get to know how to do it `man`/`help`)
- Go to the dog folder
- Rename file.txt to “beagle.txt”
- Create another file “labrador.txt”
- Go to the wolf folder
- Rename file.txt to “wolf.txt”
- type `echo "I am a big bad wolf" > wolf.txt`
- Print the content of that file on the screen
- Go to the animals folder
- type `echo "I am a junior at BeCode." > wolf/wolf.txt`
- Print the content of the wolf.txt file on the screen.

Now… Let's get back to the mouse. Enter your file explorer and see what you've done inside the desktop/animals. Explore the folders and files that are there.

### Congrats !

You are now able to manage all your files and folders on the command line. Although it might not be obvious, **the terminal is a very powerful and modern environment** , and knowing how to use it will save you loads of time.
