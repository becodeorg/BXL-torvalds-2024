## Setup

Every time I format my computer I have a little list of software / tools I need to install for my web dev job.

- VS Code
- Git / Git Bash
- GitHub Desktop (not mandatory, we can install it later in the path)
- Node.js
- Discord
- Google Chrome (Mozilla is nice to have as well)

Other than that, I make sure I have access to :

- My professional email
- My GitHub account
- My Trello/Atlassian account
- My Discord account

And finally, in my BeCode activities, I need access to :

- The Discord server of BeCode and our class.
- The Moodle platform for our course.

So now let's make sure everything is set for you! (if you don't understand yet what some of those things are, worry not ! We will get there very soon)

### VS Code

A free open source code editor developed by Microsoft that can be used with a variety of programming languages. It allows the installation of very useful extensions.

I don't want to tell you to use it but… use it ! (Of course, if you have another preference go ahead but… use VS Code !. OK… I stop… But use it !)

### GIT / GIT Bash

"**Git** is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency". It's crucial to every developer day-to-day. We'll deep dive into it very soon, but for now, make sure GIT is installed on your computer.

Git comes installed by default on most Mac and Linux machines. But just in case, make sure to install the package from the following link :

(Usually you just say YES to every default option the installation gives you. Just make sure Git Bash is checked in the installation)

### Node.js

"Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine" (blablabla…). We will use it for a BUNCH of things ! Just install it from the following link :

### Discord

"Discord **is the easiest way to talk over voice, video, and text**. Talk, chat, hang out, and stay close with your friends and communities."

At Becode, we use it every day. Make sure to install it.

### Google Chrome

Google Chrome has probably the best developer's tools for the web. Mozilla Firefox is pretty good as well. Another alternative is to install Brave, a Chrome-based browser that respects your privacy more. Don't hesitate to install all of them so we can do cross-browser testing later on.

### Professional email

OK, there are no rules here. But I strongly recommend you to get a Gmail account in order to have access to the Google Suite and be able to login directly into some other services with this email. Just make sure your email does't look like fluffyAngelXXX957@gmail.com

Make it professional !

### Github account

You are gonna be using Github **EVERY DAY !** Create an account with your email address.

### Trello

Trello is an online kanban platform. We will be using it quite often.

Login with your Gmail account.

### Discord account

You've already downloaded the Discord software. Now make an account and get in !

Great ! Normally you should be good to go ! We will install other things along the path but the essential is there !
