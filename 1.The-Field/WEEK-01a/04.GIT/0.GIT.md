## GIT and GITHUB

Hellooooww there !

Get prepared to enter the amazing (and sometimes quite confusing) world of **GIT** !!!!

This tool is crucial to your webdev career. It's certainly not the easiest and most exciting thing you will learn, but no coder can expect to live without it.

It allows developers to save and keep track of their work. If we make a mistake, we can go back in time to recoup what we lost or did wrong. It allows a team to work properly at the same time on the same projectâ€¦ All of these techniques you will have to learn and master in order to have a proper workflow as a developer, either you work alone or in a team.

The amount of new concepts to master is quite large and we will take the day to dive deep into it. (and tomorrow there will be your first group challenge with git and markdown, so get prepared !)

I have selected a series of tutorials you will have to follow in order to grasp the main concepts of it. You'll see these tutorials are all introductory ones and, therefore, you will get the same information each time, but in different manners and with different twists. Trust me : repetition, in this case, can be quite useful. Don't hesitate to speed up the video if you feel confident. Code along all the time !

So grab a coffee and let's go for it !

Watch these tutorials in order. Follow what they teach and try to practice on your own machine. At the end, follow the small exercise.

Small tip : if you like the video host, subscribe to their channel ! They have lots of content that can help you along the way.

**CLICK â‡’** [**Git, GitHub, & GitHub Desktop for beginners**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE&ab_channel=CoderCoder)

In this 21 minute tutorial, you will have a very quick grasp of the workflow you can have with git, github and github desktop. In the end, you will be far from knowing everything, but I think it's a good introduction by practice. Small comment : she uses GitHub Desktop in order to turn the explanation easier. But our goal at the end is to master git **with the terminal**. Don't get lazy !!!!! ðŸ˜˜

In this longer tutorial, Mosh goes deeper into GIT and it's also a good opportunity to review what you learned in the first two videos with a little more awareness.
