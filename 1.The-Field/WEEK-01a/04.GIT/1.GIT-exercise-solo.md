## GIT and GITHUB

### Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge, you should be able to:

- Use the knowledge you acquired with the terminal and Markdown to write a document in a workflow using GIT.
- Initialize a git repository
- Upload it to GitHub
- Clone a repository
- Use different branches to build up your document.
- Use commits.
- Merge branches
- Push to GitHub your final work

### The challenge

- Using your terminal, go to the Desktop on your computer
- Create a folder `/myGitExercise`
- Inside of it, create a `Readme.md`
- Initialize a git repository.
- Open the project in VS Code (use the terminal)
- Create a repo on GitHub.
- Follow the instructions given by GitHub to link your local git repo to the repo you created on Github

We're gonna write down a schedule for a day.

In order to do that, create a skeleton of the day using headers in the Markdown :

**MORNING**

**AFTERNOON**

**EVENING**

- Once this skeleton is done, create different branches **from the main one** : `feature-morning`, `feature-afternoon` and `feature-evening`
- When they are all created, checkout to each branch and fill out what you will do in those hours.
- Each time you finish writing in a branch, commit your work and push it to GitHub.
- In the terminal, go ahead and definitely delete the folder on your local machine. You don't have it anymore in yout machine. But it's saved on GitHub. We are just doing this so you can experiment to :
- Clone back your repository into your machine.
- Go to GitHub and make a pull request for the branch `feature-morning` into the main branch.
- Review your pull request (GitHub will show what has been added, removed or changed).
- Merge your branch.
- Close the pull request, terminating the branch.
- Do the same for the other two branches.

You have a final version of your schedule !!! Great job ! üëè

You are J-U-S-T ¬†A-W-E-S-O-M-E !!!!!

In the near future, you will collaborate with your peers in a similar (but much more complex) way. You'll see that it's not gonna be so easy and conflicts between branches will occur. Get prepared !
