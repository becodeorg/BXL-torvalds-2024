### Git/GitHub Exercise for Beginner Web Development Students

#### **Objective:**

By the end of this exercise, students should be familiar with basic Git and GitHub operations, including cloning a repository, creating branches, making changes, merging branches, handling conflicts, and submitting pull requests.

#### **Time:**

2 hours

### **Exercise Overview:**

Students will work collaboratively on a single Markdown file in a shared GitHub repository. They will clone the repository, create their own branch, make changes to the Markdown file, push their changes, and submit a pull request. They will also handle merging and resolving any conflicts that arise.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

#### **1\. Set Up the Repository (Preparation)**

- **Create a GitHub Repository:** Create a public repository named `collaborative-markdown-exercise`.

- **Add a Markdown File:** Create a `README.md` file with some basic text, such as:

  ```
  # Collaborative Markdown File

  This is a collaborative markdown file where students will add their names and a short bio.

  ## Students

  - Name: John Doe
    Bio: A web development student learning Git and GitHub.
  ```

- **Invite Students:** Add students as collaborators or share the repository link.

#### **2\. Clone the Repository**

- **Instructions for Students:**

  1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open a terminal or Git Bash and clone the repository to your local machine.

  2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**

#### **3\. Create a New Branch**

- **Instructions for Students:**

  1.  **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch named after your own name.

  2.  **Verify the Branch:** Ensure you are on the new branch.

#### **4\. Make Changes to the Markdown File**

- **Instructions for Students:**
  1.  **Edit `README.md`:** Open `README.md` in a text editor and add your name and a short bio under the "Students" section.
  2.  **Save Changes:** Save the file after editing.

#### **5\. Commit and Push Changes**

- **Instructions for Students:**

  1.  **Add the Changes:**

  2.  **Commit the Changes:**

  3.  **Push the Changes to GitHub:**

#### **6\. Create a Pull Request**

- **Instructions for Students:**
  1.  **Go to GitHub:** Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
  2.  **Create Pull Request:** Click on the "Compare & pull request" button next to your branch.
  3.  **Submit Pull Request:** Add a title and description if necessary, then click "Create pull request."

#### **7\. Merge the Pull Request (15 minutes)**

- **Instructions for Students:**
  1.  **Wait for Approval:** If collaborating with others, wait for the instructor or a peer to review and approve the pull request.
  2.  **Merge the Pull Request:** Once approved, merge your pull request.
  3.  **Delete the Branch:** After merging, delete your branch from GitHub to keep the repository clean.

#### **8\. Pull the Latest Changes**

- **Instructions for Students:**

  1.  **Switch to the `main` Branch:**

  2.  **Pull the Latest Changes:**

#### **9\. Handle Merge Conflicts**

- **Instructions for Students:**

  1.  **Simulate a Conflict:** If two students edit the same line in `README.md`, a merge conflict will occur. The instructor can create a scenario where students must resolve the conflict.

  2.  **Resolve the Conflict:** Use a text editor to resolve the conflict by choosing which changes to keep.

  3.  **Commit the Resolution:**

  4.  **Push the Changes:**

### **Conclusion:**

At the end of this exercise, students will have hands-on experience with Git/GitHub, including handling branches, making pull requests, and resolving conflicts.
