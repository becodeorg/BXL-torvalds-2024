# Exercise.

---

Create a function that takes three arguments probability, prize, pay and returns true if probability \* prize > pay; otherwise return false.

To illustrate:

`profitableGamble(0.2, 50, 9)`

... should yield true, since the net profit is 1 (0.2 \* 50 - 9), and 1 > 0.

#### Notes

A profitable gamble is a game that yields a positive net profit, where net profit is calculated in the following manner: net_outcome = probability_of_winning \* prize - cost_of_playing.

- Don't overthink this exercise. It's a simple equation that is already given in the note above ;)

#### Expected results

```
profitableGamble(0.2, 50, 9) ➞ true

profitableGamble(0.9, 1, 2) ➞ false

profitableGamble(0.9, 3, 2) ➞ true
```
