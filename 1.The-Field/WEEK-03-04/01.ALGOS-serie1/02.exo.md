# Exercise.

Create a function that takes a number as an argument. Add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you passed to the function. For example, if the input is 4 then your function should return 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

#### Notes

- Expect any positive number between 1 and 1000.

#### Expected results

```
addUp(4) ➞ 10

addUp(13) ➞ 91

addUp(600) ➞ 180300
```
