# Exercise.

---

In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

- `chickens` = 2 legs
- `cows` = 4 legs
- `pigs` = 4 legs

The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

#### Notes

- Don't forget to return the result.
- The order of animals passed is animals(chickens, cows, pigs).
- Remember that the farmer wants to know the total number of legs and not the total number of animals.

#### Expected results

```
animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36

animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22

animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50
```
