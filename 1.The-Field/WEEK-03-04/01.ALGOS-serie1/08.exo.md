Create a function that returns the number of frames shown in a given number of minutes for a certain FPS.

FPS stands for "frames per second" and it's the number of frames a computer screen shows every second.

#### Expected results

```
frames(1, 1) ➞ 60

frames(10, 1) ➞ 600

frames(10, 25) ➞ 15000
```
