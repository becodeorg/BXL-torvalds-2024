# Exercise.

A vehicle needs 10 times the amount of fuel than the distance it travels. However, it must always carry a minimum of 100 fuel before setting off.

Create a function which calculates the amount of fuel it needs, given the distance.

#### Notes

- Distance will be a number greater than zero.
- Return 100 if the calculated fuel turns out to be less than 100.

#### Expected results

```
calculateFuel(15) ➞ 150

calculateFuel(23.5) ➞ 235

calculateFuel(3) ➞ 100
```
