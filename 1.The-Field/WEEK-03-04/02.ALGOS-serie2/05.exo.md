Create a function that takes in a number as a string `n` and returns the number **without trailing and leading zeros**.

- **_Trailing Zeros_** are the zeros after a decimal point which don't affect the value (e.g. the last three zeros in 3.4000 and 3.04000).
- **_Leading Zeros_** are the zeros before a whole number which don't affect the value (e.g. the first three zeros in 000234 and 000230).

#### Notes

- Return a string.
- If you get a number with `.0` on the end, return the integer value (e.g. return `"4"` rather than `"4.0"`).
- If the number is `0`, `0.0`, `000`, `00.00`, etc... return `"0"`.

#### Expected results

```
removeLeadingTrailing("230.000") ➞ "230"

removeLeadingTrailing("00402") ➞ "402"

removeLeadingTrailing("03.1400") ➞ "3.14"

removeLeadingTrailing("30") ➞ "30"
```
