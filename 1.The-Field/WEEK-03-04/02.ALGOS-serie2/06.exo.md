# Exercise.

---

In this challenge you will be given an array similar to the following:

`[[3], 4, [2], [5], 1, 6]`

In words, elements of the array are either an integer or an array containing a single integer. We humans can clearly see that this array can reasonably be sorted according to "the content of the elements" as:

`[1, [2], [3], 4, [5], 6]`

Create a function that, given an array similar to the above, sorts the array according to the "content of the elements".

#### Notes

To reiterate, elements of the array will be either integers or arrays with a single integer.

#### Expected results

```
sortIt([4, 1, 3]) ➞ [1, 3, 4]

sortIt([[4], [1], [3]]) ➞ [[1], [3], [4]]

sortIt([4, [1], 3]) ➞ [[1], 3, 4]

sortIt([[4], 1, [3]]) ➞ [1, [3], [4]]

sortIt([[3], 4, [2], [5], 1, 6]) ➞ [1, [2], [3], 4, [5], 6]
```
