# Exercise.

---

In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided die. If you advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.

Can you reach your friend's tile number in the next roll? Create a function that takes your position a and your friend's position b and returns a boolean representation of whether it's possible to earn a bonus on any die roll.

#### Notes

- You cannot move backward (which is why example #3 doesn't work).
- If you are already on the same tile, return false, as you would be advancing away.
- Expect only positive integer inputs.

#### Expected results

```
possibleBonus(3, 7) ➞ true

possibleBonus(1, 9) ➞ false

possibleBonus(5, 3) ➞ false
```
