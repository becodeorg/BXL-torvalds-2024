Given an input string, reverse the string word by word, the first word will be the last, and so on.

#### Notes

- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- The input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

#### Expected results

```
reverseWords(" the sky is blue") ➞ "blue is sky the"

reverseWords("hello   world!  ") ➞ "world! hello"

reverseWords("a good example") ➞ "example good a"
```
