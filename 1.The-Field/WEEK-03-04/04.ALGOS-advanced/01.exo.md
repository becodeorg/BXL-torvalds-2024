## Exercise : Ransom note

---

Write a function called `ransomNote` which takes two parameters : `noteText` and `magazineText`.

The goal is : with all the words of `magazineText`, you should be able to create the `noteText`.

The function should return `true` if we are able to write the `noteText` with the words from `magazineText` or `false` if we can't.

#### Notes

Here are two examples :

```
noteText = "this is a secret note to you from a secret admirer"
```

```
magazineText = "puerto rico is a great place you must hike far from town to find a secret waterfall that i am an admirer of but note that it is not as hard as it seems this is my advice to you"
```

In the case above, it would be `false`. Why ? Because all the words are present, but `secret` appears only once in the `magazineText`, but there are two `secret` in the `noteText`

If the `noteText` was

```
"this is a note to you from a secret admirer"
```

That would work and would be `true`

Test your code with these text and others.
