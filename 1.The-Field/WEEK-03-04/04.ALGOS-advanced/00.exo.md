## Exercise : The FizzBuzz

---

Create a functions that takes a `num` argument. You should then console.log all numbers from 1 to `num`.

But here’s the catch : multiple of 3 should print `“Fizz”` and multiples of 5 shoudl print `“Buzz”`. Lastly if the number is multiple of 3 and 5, it should print `FizzBuzz`

#### Notes

- Your code should be modular. You must be able to pass any numbers as `n` and the code should still work.

#### Expected results

In the console, if the `num` is 20, for example :

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz

```
