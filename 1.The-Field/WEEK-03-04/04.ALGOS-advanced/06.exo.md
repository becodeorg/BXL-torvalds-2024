# Exercise. Two sums

---

Write a function that takes as argument an array of numbers `numArray` and the `sum` we want to obtain.

Your function should return every pair of numbers from `numArray` that adds up to the 'sum'

#### Notes

- The result should be an array of arrays.
- Any number in the array can be used in multiple pairs (look at the "4" in the exemple below)

#### Expected results

```js
// For "sum" = 7
[1, 6, 4, 5, 3, 3] ---> [[6,1], [3,4], [3,4]]
```
