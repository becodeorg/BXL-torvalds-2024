# Exercise. Caesar Cipher

---

Caesar Cipher is a way of "encrypting" a text that, supposably, Julius Caesar used in his communication.

We switch every letter with, for example, two letters before in the alphabet.

The Caesar cipher function will take two parameters `str` and `num`; `str` represents the text we want to cipher and `num` de amount of letters you want to go forward or backward (using negative numbers)

#### Notes

- Make it case incensitive
- You should be able to loop back or forward into de the alphabet (if you have to go 3 from `z`, it would be `c`)

#### Expected results

```js
caesarCipher("zoo keeper", 2) ----> "bqq mggrgt"

caesarCipher("bqq mggrgt", -2) ----> "zoo keeper"

caesarCipher("My name is Henrique", 3) ----> "pb qdph lv khqultxh "


```
