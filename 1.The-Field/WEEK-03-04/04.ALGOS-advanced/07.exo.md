# Exercise. Fibonacci

---

Fibonacci sequence starts with `1` and `1` and the next numbers are always the sum of the last two numbers. So... Here is the sequence :

`1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...`

Write a function that takes a `num` number and returns an array with the `num` first elements of the Fibonacci sequence.

#### Notes

- Recursion would be the best way to solve it but there is another simple way.

#### Expected results

```js
fibonacci(4) ----> [1, 1, 2, 3]
fibonacci(9) ----> [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
fibonacci(6) ----> [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

```
