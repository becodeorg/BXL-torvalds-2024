# Little Rainbow exercise

---

- Write a program that gives the body background the color `blue`
- 1 second later it becomes `yellow`
- 1 second later it becomes `red`
- 1 second later it becomes `cyan`
- 1 second later it becomes `violet`
- 1 second later it becomes `green`
- 1 second later it becomes `purple`

Wait a minute... it's the same than the other one ?

Yes... but this time use `promises` to generate it. See the difference in the code !
