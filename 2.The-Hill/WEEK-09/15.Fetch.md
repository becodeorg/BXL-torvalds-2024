# Fetch

---

YOUPIIII !!!! Let's start requesting API's within our code !

There is an old way of doing it using what we call XHR. But it's clunky and with several drawbacks.

We are going to focus here on `fetch`.

`fetch` is a method that makes a request to a particular endpoint. It returns a promise.

That means we can use it with async/await (or .then and .catch) !

The syntax is pretty simple : You call `fetch` with the endpoint you want :

```js
fetch("https://catfact.ninja/fact");
```

Because it returns a promise, you'll have to chain the .then / .catch (or put it into an async function)

```js
fetch("https://catfact.ninja/fact")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

You'll already have a response object with several attributes like :

- headers
- ok (boolean to check if the data was received)
- status
- url
  etc.

You also get the attribute `body` where we can find the data from the responses.

The problem is that, unfortunately, `body` doesn't give us automatically the json requested.

That's because of the way `fetch` works : the promise is fulfilled as soon as it receives the `headers`

We have to parse the body to become json. And the response object has a method for that : `json()`

So... don't get confused. It's pretty straight forward :

- We fetch the endpoint
- We receive a response
- We convert the response into json with its own method.
- This conversion is a promise as well.

So.. with async await :

```js
const fetchData = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://catfact.ninja/fact");
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
};
```

Call the function and there you are ! The data from the API is there !

Now, as we can see, `fetch` is a function (a method of the window object). So we pass as first argument the string of the url we want to hit.

```js
fetch("https://catfact.ninja/fact");
```

As second argument, we can pass an object that will have many properties to give more information to this request.

So...

```js
fetch("https://catfact.ninja/fact", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  }, // etc.
});
```

There are several options we can pass to the fetch request. You don't need to know all of them. Once you need something, you will have to look for it. Google is your friend. (and the docs of the APIs as well !)

This is a global advise I give you :

There are so many possibilities and use cases in web development, that the first thing we need to know is how to go look for it.

These articles are really the basic content you should know. But the vast majority of your knowledge should come with practice and research !
