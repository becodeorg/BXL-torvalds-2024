# JSON

---

`JSON` stands for **J**ava**S**ript **O**bject **N**otation

It's a format that only serves to gives us data. No markup, styling, etc. Just data !

As its name says, it formats data in a JavaScript `object`-like format. There are only a few differences.

Look at this object :

```js
const myObj = {
  firstName: "Henrique",
  lastName: "Vieira",
  age: 35,
  hasPets: false,
};
```

We can easily convert this object to a JSON format (actually, we already did it sooner in the course).

```js
const myJson = JSON.stringify(myObj);

console.log(myJson);

// It will return the string :
/*
"{"firstName":"Henrique","lastName":"Vieira","age":35,"hasPets":false}"
*/
```

JSON is, first of all, a string !
A string that reproduces more or less the structure of an object.

So we can easily converts it back to an object.

```js
console.log(JSON.parse(myJson));

// It will return an object :

/*

{
  firstName: "Henrique",
  lastName: "Vieira",
  age: 35,
  hasPets: false,
};

*/
```

That's a pretty easy way to exchange date between computers. The server can respond only with a giant string that JavaScript will be able to convert to an object.

Small precisions :

- Even if it looks like an object, it is NOT an object !
- There are some differences :
  - Every key is a string with double quote
  - The values accepted are
    - `strings`
    - `numbers`
    - `boolean`
    - `null`
    - `arrays`
    - `objects`

`undefined` for example is not valid JSON
