# AJAX

---

**OOOOOOh Kaaaayy !!!!**

Things are gonna get funnier now.

Remember when early on in the course we talked about the HTTP process (a means of communication between different computers) and the request/response cycle ?

Each time we are interacting with the internet, we are making requests and receiving responses. That happens all the time.

Each time you enter an URL into your browser, the browser automatically sends a request to the server that holds the content of this URL. If we refresh the page, same thing !

But... Did you know that we can do requests on demand with JavaScript ? (Duh... of course you knew !)

That's what we are going to see in this part.

Let me introduce you the term **AJAX**

AJAX stands for `Asynchrounous Javascript And XML`

XML is a markup language that contains data that can be exchanged between computers.

But nowadays we don't use it anymore. We use JSON !

So, the correct name today should be `AJAJ`. But it doesn't sound good. :P

Anyways... `JSON` will be the format we are going to work with

Basically, when we resquest a particular url (`endpoint`), instead of responding us with some HTML, Css and JS, they will respond with a JSON document.
