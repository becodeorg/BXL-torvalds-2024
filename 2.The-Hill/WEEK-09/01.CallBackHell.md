# Callback hell

---

For a long time, before JavaScript benefited from some new implementation, the only way to wait for some asynchronous code to run before running something else was `callback functions`.

It's exactly what happens inside a `setTimeOut` : we wait for something (the timer) and then we run a function.

Let's revisit the last piece of code of the last article :

```js
let str = "Initial";

setTimeout(() => {
  str = "End";
}, 1);

console.log(str);
```

We could resolve that with :

```js
let str = "Initial";

setTimeout(() => {
  str = "End";
  console.log(str);
}, 1);
```

That means : We called the function `log` inside the callback.

Now what if we have many actions depending on an async code ?

We quickly enter a pattern like this :

```js
const retrieveAsyncData(()=>{
    doSomething(()=>{ // Depending on the data
        doSomethingMore(()=>{ // Depending on the function before
            thenDoAnotherThing() // Depending on the function before
            // Etc.
        })
    })
})

```

This is what we call `callback hell`.

We have to nest callback inside callback, inside callback... to perform what we need from async code.

The result is an illegible code very hard to maintain.

There's gotta be a better solution !

Well... there is !!!!

But first... Let's do an exercise :

---

- Write a program that gives the body background the color `blue`
- 1 second later it becomes `yellow`
- 1 second later it becomes `red`
- 1 second later it becomes `cyan`
- 1 second later it becomes `violet`
- 1 second later it becomes `green`
- 1 second later it becomes `purple`

Sounds pretty simple isn'it ?

But here are the restrictions :

- You **CAN'T** use `setInterval`
- You **MUST** set your `setTimeout` to `1` second for each color. (no doing maths counting 1,2,3,4,5 etc.)
