# Postman

---

Ok... You may have heard about it, but when you enter an url with your browser, you're doing a `GET` request.

When we talk about APIs we'll see there are several request methods we can (and will) use.

Not all APIs (actually a small part of them) can be accessed directly by calling its endpoint.

That's why we are going to install a software called `Postman`

With Postman, we can make several requests without having to code our request.

Download it [here](https://www.postman.com/) (you'll have to register. It's free !)

Create a workspace and add a new request with the PLUS (`+`) button

Start making a `GET` request to `https://becode.org`

The result is predictable : you get a whole html page with all its style and js, etc.

That's basically your browser doing a `GET` request to a page.

Now let's try a differente endpoint :

`api.github.com/users/VieiraHenrique`

You get all the json data about my personal GitHub repo sent to us by the backend of GitHub.

This article was just to introduce you to Postman, that will become a great friend of ours in order to test APIs before coding our requests.
