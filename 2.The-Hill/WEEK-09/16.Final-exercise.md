# Final exercise

---

**OOOaaaaakaayyyy !**

That was a lot of information on some basic concepts.

We will now do an exercise to practice API calls and DOM manipulation.

**_The mission_**

Using [this](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) api, create a little program as follow :

- There is a text input where you should be able to type something related to food, a meal, etc.

- When you press ENTER, you should fetch all meals related to the search field.

- You should then display in a grid the image of each meal and its title.

- A little text should also say : `these are the results for "chicken"`, for example

- When you click on a meal, you should open a modal with the following meal information :

  - Image cover
  - Title
  - List of ingredients and how much of them you will need
  - A description on how to cook it.

- You should be able to close the modal and search for another meal as many times you want.

- Make it pretty ! Think of containers, menu, harmonic colors, etc.

Good luck, my friends ! ;)
