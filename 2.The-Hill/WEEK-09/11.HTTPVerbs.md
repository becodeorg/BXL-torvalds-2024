# HTTP Verbs

---

We've talked about `GET` requests and even `POST` requests.

These are what we call `http verbs`

If you go into Postman, at the left of the url request, you can chose between several verbs : `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, etc.

(there are more, but these are the main ones we will use. I never had to use another one than these)

For the same url, I can send different kinds of request.

Look at the doc of the [cat facts api](https://catfact.ninja/#/Facts)

You can see it expects a `GET` request to each of their three endpoints.

Most of these simple and free APIs will only work with the `GET` method.

Try to do a `POST` request to the cat facts api. You'll see you're gonna get a `404 - Not found`.

Because the backend of this API is not listening to a `POST` request for this endpoint.

Small apetizer :

A `GET` request is mostly used to retrieve data without sending any information from our side.

In the other hand `POST` requests will permit us to send information to the server.

This can be to change something in the database of the server, or, in many cases, send authentication information so the server can validate our request and send us back the data we want.

These verbs are different 'actions' we can perform with requests and, ultimately, it will all depend on how the server is configured to receive these different kinds of request.

(Spoiler alert : We will be building an API ourselves when we'll get to backend development)
