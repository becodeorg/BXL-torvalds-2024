# HTTP Status codes

---

We'll definetely have to handle status codes when we will build our own backend.

But for now, we've already encountered some status codes.

In Postman, for example, when you make a successfull request, you get the `200` status code which means : `ok`. The request was successfull !

You've all heard of the status code `404`, meaning `ressource not found`.

There are several status codes that help us undestand what's going on with our requests.

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) is the list of them.

Several status codes are rare to find.

What is important here is to know that there are :

- Successful responses (in the 200's)
- Redirection messages (in the 300's)
- Client error responses (in the 400's)
- Server error responses (in the 500's)

Client error responses means your request was bad. You either asked for something that doesn't exist, or something that is not authorized for you, forbidden... It can mean that the method you used (the http verb) is not allowed...

Server error responses means the server wasn't able to respond due to a server error. For example, the server encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.

Read the many status code descriptions to have an idea of the possibilities.
