# Query Strings

---

We've already seen a little bit query strings when we saw HTML Forms. When you make a `GET` request, you can pass parameters to the URL.

`https://www.mysite.com?color=blue&size=l`

Here, we have two key/value pairs indicating that "color" is "blue" and "size" is "l"

These query strings will always be ignored by the the server unless it's specifically looking for one of these things.

So technically, you could put query strings wherever you want, it's not gonna affect anything unless the website wants them.

The format of a query string is always like this :

`url?key=value&key=value` etc..

Now, enter the `mdn` [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and look for the search bar. Type `chicken` inside of it and search.

Look at the url now :

`https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=chicken`

So... the server of `mdn` in the page `search` is looking for a query string `q` in order to display all the content relative to... well... "chicken" in this case.

Now... try to delete the word "chicken" from the url

MDN was smart enough to foresee this possibility and displays to you "no query, no results"...

This means... it's not a bad request. You don't get a 404. It's just that some websites at some pages need such a query string.

You can check this on several websites.

Look at this :

`https://fr.zalando.be/catalogue/?q=chaussure+tenis`

This is the results of the search "chaussure tenis" on Zalando's page.

It's not a different `endpoint`. (The endpoint is the url itself), it's just some parameters we pass on to it that the server can use to do some stuff.

In `Postman` you can add query params in the `Params` tab. It's just to help you pass them without having to write it after the url
