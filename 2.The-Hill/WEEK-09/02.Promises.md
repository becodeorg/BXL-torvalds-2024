# Promises

---

Ok... buckle up your seatbelt ! Let's try to uderstand the concept of `promises`. Don't worry, I didn't get it on the first time !

_"A `promise` is an `object` representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchrounous operation"_.

When wa call some data from an API for example, we don't know how long it will take. It can take 5ms, 1s, 5s ! Eventually, it can timeout and never come (that's the failure of the operation).

In the old way, we would create a function that takes two callbacks : one for the success, one for the error.

Then, in case of success and if we still wanted to do something with the data (which is most likely), we would call another function inside of it, etc. (callback hell)

A `Promise` is an object that will hold, as soon as it's available, the data retreived. It also contains two handy methods `then()` and `catch()`.

The `then` method will wait for the promise to be resolved and then will run a callback.

The handy thing here is that, instead of puting another callback inside the callback, we can just chain the `then` method.

The `catch` method runs a callback if something went wrong.

Ok... Oufff... Let's try to understand this in practice.

Let's do a little experiments with both callbacks and then promises.
