# Exercise 1.

---

For this first exercise, we will do a **form validation**.

The form will have the following fields :

- first name
- last name
- age
- email
- phone number
- password
- repeat password

The goal is :

- No error message is displayed at start.
- When we submit the form, it evaluates the inputs and gives error messages (red outline of the input and red text saying the requirements for the field) or success (green outline)
- For the errors, you will have to correct it, and while you're correcting, the error or success feedback is given in real time. (it changes automatically when you're typing)
- After everything is validated and you submit it, you should display all the information entered in a list (`ul`) after the form itself.

This exercise will require several concepts in React :

- useState
- onSubmit
- onChange
- ternary operator
- etc. etc.

There isn't only one possible way of doing it. Think of clever ways. (Objects to hold information ? :P)
