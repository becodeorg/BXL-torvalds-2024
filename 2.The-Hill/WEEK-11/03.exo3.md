# Exercise 3.

---

Let's get serious now !

I will provide you a json file with several entries (electronic products) in the following format :

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "iPhone 14",
  "price": 1289.57,
  "currency": "â‚¬",
  "year": "2024",
  "stock": 57,
  "imgSrc": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619HAuZ95QL._AC_UL480_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg"
}
```

Think of these as the response from an API.

The goal here is to create a store management application.

You are the manager of your electronic store and you will build a dahsboard with all the products you have in stock.

For each product, give all the information about it and show the picture.

Make it possible to increase/decrease the stock, delete a product and change all the information about it.

Beyond that, we will be using **react router** to create a second page where you can, through a form, create a new product. Make all the validation required for this form.

This can be a really nice project. Go for it !
