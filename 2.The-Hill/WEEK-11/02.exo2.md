# Exercise 2.

---

For this second exercise, let's tackle something you never did : a **todo list** !!!!

But there is an extra feature ! We will be storing the todos in a JSON file !

A "fake" local api thanks to the package [json server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). With it, you will be able to have kind of a database in a json file.

Read thoroughly the docs of `json server` to understand how it works.

Don't hesitate to use Postman before implementing it in your code.

---

The todo list is as usual :

A text input, a list, a cross to delete it and, this time : the possibility to edit the todo.

Everything must communicate in real time with the json file.

This exercise will require several concepts in React :

- useState
- useEffect
- async fetch
- onSubmit
- onChange
- onClick
- ternary operator
- etc. etc.

Warning : when you add a todo, it should appear immediately in the list ! When you delete a todo as well !
