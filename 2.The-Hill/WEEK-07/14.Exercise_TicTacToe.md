# Exercise : Tic Tac Toe game

---

Let's create a tic-tac-toe game !

This exercise will require a good undestanding of :

- combining css with javascript
- arrays
- creating elements and applying different classes/attributes to them
- append children to a parent element
- apply event listeners
- remove event listeners

You know the rules of tic-tac-toe ! The first to complete a straight line of 3 wins the game !

Start with an html as such :

```html
<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
<div class="board"></div>
<p class="message">Message here</p>
<button class="restart">Restart</button>
```

All the rest will be handled by JavaScript and CSS

Here are some tips on how you could do it :

- Create 9 divs inside `board` with the class `cell`
- In your css, make sure `board` and `cell`s look like the game grid
- We are going to use the strategy of putting the letters `x` and `o` inside the divs in order to play the game. (you can do it differently, but you will have to adapt your js)
- In your js, you can start defining all the winning combinations with an array of arrays :

```js
const winCombinations = [
  [0, 1, 2],
  [3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8],
  [0, 3, 6],
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [0, 4, 8],
  [2, 4, 6],
];
```

- You will need an array of 9 entries `playedCells` to hold the choices of the players. (you can start with empty strings, and then it will be filled with `x` and `o`)

- Keep track of the current player (in a variable) and assign it to `x` or `o`
- Keep track if the game is running or over
- In the initialization of the game, add an event listener to each cell.
- When a cell is clicked, fill the `playedCells` with the current player in the correct position
- Check if there is a win comparing the `winCombinations` array to the `playedCells`
