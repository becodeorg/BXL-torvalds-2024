# Event bubbling and delegation and the event object

## Bubbling

Let's tackle the quite annoying but essential subject of bubbling and delegation when we are dealing with events. (Mostly the "click" one)

Let's consider this markup :

```html
<div class="parent">
  <p>
    I am a child of my parent
    <button>I am a child of the paragraph</button>
  </p>
</div>
```

Let's say you create an eventListener to listen to the click on the button

```js
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("button was clicked");
});
```

If you try by yourself you'll see that everything happens as expected.

If you click the button, you'll get the alert.

What you might not know is that, clicking the button you are **also** clicking the `p`, and ultimately the `div` as well.

After all, the button is a child of those and is contained inside of them.

This is not necessarely a problem but can cause some...

Let's say you also want to put a click event on the paragraph that alerts `paragraph was clicked`

Try for your self ;)

See ? If you click the button you will get the alert `button was clicked` and then : the paragraph click listener is fired as well and you get an alert with `paragraph was clicked`.

It's easy to prevent this to happen. But first, let me introduce you to the `event object`

---

## The `event` object

When you create an eventListener, you give it the kind of event you are expecting and the function that will be called when the event happens.

```js
element.addEventListener("click", function () {
  // Some code...
});
```

What you didn't know is that this function receives automatically as a parameter an object that we call the `event object`.

It's an object with all the information about the event that just fired.

Try this :

```js
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```

You can see in the console a whole object with many properties and methods. This object represents the event itself. We will use it for several actions in different occasions.

For now, let's get back to bubbling :

##### How to prevent an event to bubble to the parent element ?

Well... there is a handy method on the `event object` called `stopPropagation()`

Inside the function fired in the event listener, just call it and it will stop bubbling ;)

With the precedent example, try again, now with this method :

```html
<div class="parent">
  <p>
    I am a child of my parent
    <button>I am a child of the paragraph</button>
  </p>
</div>
```

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const p = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  alert("button was clicked");
});

p.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("paragraph was clicked");
});
```

You see that now, you don't have the bubbling effect anymore.

That's is ! ;)

## Delegation

`Event delegation` is more a strategy than a functionnality.

The `event object` has a property called `target` that returns the specific element that was clicked (for example)

Imagine this usecase :

```html
<div class="parent">
  <button>One</button>
  <button>Two</button>
  <button>Three</button>
  <button>Four</button>
  <button>Five</button>
  <button>Six</button>
  <button>Seven</button>
  <button>Eight</button>
</div>
```

Let's say I want to have a click event listener to each one of the buttons.

Do I have to give a class to each one and select them one by one in order to do my logic for each one ?

There has to be a better way !

And there is !!!!

We know that by clicking any of these buttons, we are also clicking the `.parent` div.

So why not put a click event listener to the parent and not to each button ? Then we could use the target with conditions to do specif things... Let's see !

Try first this :

```js
parent.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  console.log(e.target);
});
```

See ? Each time you get a different return depending on where you clicked !

So now we can put conditions for each case and perform actions on them.

```js
parent.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.innerText === "One") {
    alert("You clicked the first button");
  }

  if (e.target.innerText === "Two") {
    alert("Elodie loves cats");
  }

  if (e.target.innerText === "Three") {
    alert("I am so happy !");
  }
  // etc...
});
```

You don't have to make a condition regarding only the innerText. You can also use the `matches()` method :

```js
document.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches(".my-class")) {
    // Handle clicks on the elements with "my-class" class
  }
  if (e.target.matches("li")) {
    // Handle clicks on all li in the page
  }
  // etc
});
```
