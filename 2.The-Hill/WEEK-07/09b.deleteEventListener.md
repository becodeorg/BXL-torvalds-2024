# Remove event listener

---

Did you know you can remove an event listener as well ?

The only caveat is that you can't use anonymous functions to add your event listener. It must be a named function :

```js
const myFunc = () => {
  console.log("clicked");
};

element.addEventListener("click", myFunc);

// Then you can later remove the event listener specifying that it should remove the "click" event to this specific function.

element.removeEventListener("click", myFunc);
```

This can be quite handy sometimes ;)
