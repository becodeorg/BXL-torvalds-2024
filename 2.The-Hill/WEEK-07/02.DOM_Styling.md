# DOM manipulation : styling

---

We just saw it in the last article : One of the object properties almost every element of the DOM have is `style`.

The properties of `style` are all the CSS properties. The only difference is that it's camel case. So :

`text-decoration` would be `textDecoration`
`font-size` would be `fontSize`
etc.

You can assign it to a string that contains exactly what you would write in CSS.

```js
document.querySelector("#myID").style.fontSize = "2rem";
```

Good to know : the `style` attribute you give to an element will be implemented as `inline-style`.

You can verify this, by given - for example - a color to the main title through JavaScript and then inspect the element. You'll see that the h1 will have an inline-style with the color you gave it.

This is important because of... ? `specificity` !!! Remember ? The inline-style has the higher specificity in CSS.

Just a reminder from the last article :

If you select a group of elements (all `li` for example), you will end up with an `ARRAY`(-like) ! So you can't assign a style to the array. You must loop over it.
