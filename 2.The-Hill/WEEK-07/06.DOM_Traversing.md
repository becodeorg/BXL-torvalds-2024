# Traversing the DOM

---

Ok... you are a few steps to become a DOM master !

But before you do, patient you must be.

Let's try to understand the concept of **_traversing the DOM_**

---

By now, you understood that the DOM (as the HTML structure, once they are intimately related) has a hierarchical relationship.

A parent (the **_document_**) has children (the **_body_** tag for example).

The body itself has many children (let's say **_divs_**) that have siblings (the other **_divs_**) and children by their own...

Look at this structure :

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>I am the title</h1>
    <p>And I am a <span>description</span></p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>I am a subtitle</h2>
    <p>I am a paragraph with <b>bold</b> text</p>
    <a href="#">I am a button</a>
  </div>
</body>
```

Already the indentation shows us clearly the relatioship.

`body` is the parent.

`body` has two children : the two `div`s with a **_container_** class. (they are siblings to each other)

The first container `div` has two children :

- the `h1`
- the `p`
  (they are siblings to each other)

AND... the `p` has a child : the `span`

etc. etc.

It's a whole family !

We saw that we could select a particular element with `querySelector` and a group of elements with `querySelectorAll`.

But it's quite constraining to have to select elements one by one each time we want to manipulate these elements.

Fortunately, we have methods to select direct parents, children and siblings (and these methods can be chained) in order to help us.

The main expressions we will use are :

```js
// To parents
parentElement; // Represents the parent element

// To children
children; // Represents an array of all children

// To sibling
nextElementSibling; // Represents the next sibling element

previousElementSibling; // Ok... you got this one ;)
```

That's it !
There are others, and you can look for them to undestand their differences (like `parentNode`, `childNodes`, etc)

But these are the main ones we will use.

#### Chaining

These expresssions can be chained, each time relative to the previous one.

For this html :

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>I am the title</h1>
    <p>And I am a <span>description</span></p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>I am a subtitle</h2>
    <p>I am a paragraph with <b>bold</b> text</p>
    <a href="#" class="my-btn">I am a button</a>
  </div>
</body>
```

We could do : "come from the button in the second .container and go to the span inside the paragraph of the first container" (why not ?):

```js
const button = document.querySelector(".my-btn");

const mySpan =
  button.parentElement.previousElementSibling.querySelector("span");
```

See what we did ?

We went from the button to its parent (the second `.container`), then we went to the previous sibling (the first `.container`) and from it, we made a `querySelector` to select the first `span` it has inside.

From now on, we can use this `mySpan` to do whatever we want !

```js
mySpan.style.color = "red";
```

Why not ? We do whatever we want !
