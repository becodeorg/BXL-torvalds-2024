# DOM : Attributes and classes

---

We know HTML is not only about texts. HTML tags are full of attributes.

Want a recap on what are attributes in HTML ?

Well... `class` is an attribute for example.

`id` is another one.

The `alt` for an alternative text to an image is an attribute as well...

The `src` of an image is an attribute.

Remember the `data-something=""` ? This is a custom attribute.

Pretty much everything you put inside a tag is an attribute !

Can we create/remove/manipulate attributes via JavaScript ? I am glad you asked !

OF COURSE WE CAN !!!

The most straight forward way to change an attribute is using these methods :

```js
setAttribute("id", "my-awesome-id"); // In this case, we give as an argument the name of the attribute and its value.

getAttribute("id"); // Here, we specify we want to retrieve the id of the element.

removeAttribute("id"); // Duh! You get it...
```

### Classes

Handling classes are so commmon that we have particular methods to work with them.

Let's see these ones :

`classList` and its methods `add`, `remove`, `contains` and `toggle`

`classList` represents all classes of the selected element. It's the list of classes this element has.

So, for example :

```html
<p>Hello world</p>
```

The paragraph doesn't have any class. So if you do this :

```js
const parag = document.querySelector("p");

console.log(parag.classList);
```

You'll get an empty list. (not an `undefined` ! Because the object `classList` exists natively)

Now, let's do a :

```js
parag.classList.add("hello");
```

The result is :

```html
<p class="hello">Hello world</p>
```

Then :

```js
parag.classList.add("goodbye");
```

The result is :

```html
<p class="hello goodbye">Hello world</p>
```

Now, we can overrite everything :

```js
parag.classList = "one two three";
```

```html
<p class="one two three">Hello world</p>
```

And then remove just the class `two`

```js
parag.classList.remove("two");
```

Another method is `contains()`. It returns `true` or `false` if the element has the class or not.

```js
parag.classList.contains("one"); // Returns true

parag.classList.contains("two"); // Returns false
```

Another very handy one is `toggle()`.

You pass as a parameter the name of the class. If it exists in the classList it will remove it, if it doesn't it will add ;)

```html
<p class="red">Hello</p>
```

```js
document.querySelector("p").classList.toggle("red"); // Will remove red from the classes of p
// If you do it again :
document.querySelector("p").classList.toggle("red"); // It will add back the class red
```

Another often used attribute type is the `dataset`.

You will often see something like that in a HTML element : `data-something="abracadabra"`

It's a way of easily set / get the values of custom data attributes you have in your HTML elements.

This can be helpfull for several reasons.

You can, for example, use these data attributes to "flag" certain `div`s that should behave in a specific way through your javascript.

Let's see an example. Let's say I made a function that makes an element fade away on the screen. It can go to left, top, right or bottom.

The behavior (movement and opacity) is the same. It just changes the direction depending on the dataset you put on each div.

So your HTML could look like :

```html
<div data-direction="top">This div goes to the top</div>
<div data-direction="left">This div goes to the left</div>
<div data-direction="right">This div goes to the right</div>
<div data-direction="bottom">This div goes to the bottom</div>
```

In your JS, you could have something like that (in pseudo-code) :

```

Function Animate :

    Go to opacity 0;
    variable direction = data-direction
    Move to : direction

```

Got it ?

Now let's see how we can access and change data attributes :

The object that contains all data attributes is called `dataset`.

So you can call it from your element with the dot notation and then call the specific attribute you are looking for :

```html
<div class="block" data-direction="top" data-duration="400">
  This div goes to the top
</div>
```

```js
const block = document.querySelector(".block");

console.log(block.dataset);
```

Result:

```
{
    direction: "top",
    duration: "400"
}
```

In your code in JS, you can then easily access the information of this specific `div` :

```js
if (block.dataset.direction === "top" && block.dataset.duration === "400") {
  // Do something nice !
}
```
