# Exercise Swiper

---

With this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BFjpXvlLyOHOek3jsn9yKe/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev), reproduce the following behavior :

- All images are grayed out (black overlay of 75% opacity)
- When we click in a picture, it's not grayed out anymore and the right box should slide to show the bio of the character.

Use the librarie swiper to do this.

Tip :

- Find a way to have the pictures as pagination. This will require some JavaScript manipulations. The docs and google are your friends ! ;)
