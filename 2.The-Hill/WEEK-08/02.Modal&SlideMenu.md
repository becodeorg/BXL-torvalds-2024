# Exercise Modal and Slide Menu

---

### Let's create a modal !

The exercise is simple :
There is a button on the page and when you click the button a modal opens.

The modal should be a white "box" in the middle of the page with some text.

The rest of the page will have a dark overlay. And you should't be able to scroll when the modal is opened. (make the body height 200vh so you can test it)

Put a little cross on the top right of the box to close the modal.

You should also be able to to click outside the box (on the overlay) in order to close the modal.

It's a simple exercise but there are several little catches in doing a modal.

Tips :

- Use a div that takes the whole page with semi-transparent black background (the overlay) that will take an event listener in order to close the modal.
- You will have to play with z-index

### Let's create a slide menu !

See the slide menu we have on some mobile pages ?

Let's do that on a desktop page.

At the top left of the page, put a "hamburger" icon. When we click it, a menu that takes the whole height of the page should enter sliding from outside the page.

You can use JS or plain CSS, as you wish. ;)

Done ? Give yourself a hug !
