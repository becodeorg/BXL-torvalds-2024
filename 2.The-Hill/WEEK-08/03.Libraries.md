# Librairies

---

In your web dev career, you'll see that very often you won't need to reinvent the wheel. You will be using pieces of code from other people.

That's exactly what **libraries** are : pieces (sometimes quite long) of code that help us achieving things that otherwise would be very long and fastidious.

In a real job, you will use them **ALL THE TIME !**

In this section, we will get back to our old and friendly CSS (Sass) to build an amazing web page, this time with some animation, slider and lightboxes.

Here are the four libraries we will use :

- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/get-started#installation)
- [FSLightbox](https://fslightbox.com/javascript)
- [WayPoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/guides/getting-started/)

I won't tell you how to use them. They have documentation on their websites. Sometimes the documentation is good, sometimes not. Welcome to the developer's life ! :o

The only thing I will ask you for now is to implement the libraries through CDN.

Don't use NPM for now.

When we talk about CDN, we are basically saying that we will request the code directly from a server.

Remember how we link our js to an HTML ?

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

Well... it's the same but the file is not on your computer. It's over there in the cloud.

So, for example, for AOS it's gonna be :

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.js"></script>
```

Pay attention that some times a library comes also with a CSS file to be included. In which case you'll have to insert the css via cdn in your `head` tag as well.

You must read the docs to see if it's the case.

On the next article, you'll encounter some exercises with these particular libraries. And then you can tackle the big figma project ;)

Good luck !
