## EX5

Please create a simple checkerboard pattern by making the even squares black and the odd squares red. Your result should look like the image below. Please write your styles inside the space I provided, and do not change any other style :)

Please note: the solution needs to select both the even and odd squares, changing the background color of the entire board will work visually, but will not pass the exercise parameters.
