# CSS Grid

---

Another recent(ish) display property is grid. It also facilitates our use of layouts - like flex - but this time it's in two dimensions !

#### Definition

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
