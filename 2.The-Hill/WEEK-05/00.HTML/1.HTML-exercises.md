There is a snowman entity code. Find it! (you will need to google it)

Use the registered trademark entity code (the circled R at the end) , AND be sure to make it superscript

Note: No one expects you to memorize any of the entity codes. Get used to googling them! It's normal!

5.  **_Table Practice Exercise_**
    It's time to get some practice with all those table-related elements! (yikes) Your goal is to create a 3x3 table, with proper headings. (so it's really 4x3 if you count the heading cells) I've provided you with some starter data in html-exercises-tables, though you do not have to use it. Just make sure you create a 3x3 table with a row of headings at the top, using the correct semantic elements. You are expected to use the following elements: table, thead, tr, th, tbody, and td

Here is what the table would look like with the starter data provided :

   1. Username

      a. Text Input

      b. Should have placeholder text of 'username'

      c. Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)

   2. Password

      a. Password Input

      b. Should have placeholder text of 'password'

      c. Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)

   3. A Button

I added in some `<div>` elements for spacing, but you don't need to:
